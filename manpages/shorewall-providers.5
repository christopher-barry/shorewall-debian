.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define additional routing tables\&. You will want to define an additional table if:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You have connections to more than one ISP or multiple connections to the same ISP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You run Squid as a transparent proxy on a host other than the firewall\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You have other requirements for policy routing\&.
.RE
.PP
Each entry in the file defines a single routing table\&.
.PP
If you wish to omit a column entry but want to include an entry in the next column, use "\-" for the omitted entry\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBNAME\fR \- \fIname\fR
.RS 4
The provider
\fIname\fR\&. Must be a valid shell variable name\&. The names \*(Aqlocal\*(Aq, \*(Aqmain\*(Aq, \*(Aqdefault\*(Aq and \*(Aqunspec\*(Aq are reserved and may not be used as provider names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNUMBER\fR \- \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
The provider number \-\- a number between 1 and 15\&. Each provider must be assigned a unique value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMARK\fR (Optional) \- \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
A FWMARK
\fIvalue\fR
used in your
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-tcrules(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file to direct packets to this provider\&.
.sp
If HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2, then the value must be a multiple of 256 between 256 and 65280 or their hexadecimal equivalents (0x0100 and 0xff00 with the low\-order byte of the value being zero)\&. Otherwise, the value must be between 1 and 255\&. Each provider must be assigned a unique mark value\&. This column may be omitted if you don\*(Aqt use packet marking to direct connections to a particular provider and you don\*(Aqt specify
\fBtrack\fR
in the OPTIONS column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDUPLICATE\fR \- \fIrouting\-table\-name\fR
.RS 4
The name of an existing table to duplicate to create this routing table\&. May be
\fBmain\fR
or the name of a previously listed provider\&. You may select only certain entries from the table to copy by using the COPY column below\&. This column should contain a dash ("\-\*(Aq) when USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR[:\fIaddress\fR]
.RS 4
The name of the network interface to the provider\&. Must be listed in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2\&. In general, that interface should not have the
\fBproxyarp\fR
option specified unless
\fBloose\fR
is given in the OPTIONS column of this entry\&.
.sp
Where more than one provider is serviced through a single interface, the
\fIinterface\fR
must be followed by a colon and the IP
\fIaddress\fR
of the interface that is supplied by the associated provider\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGATEWAY\fR \- {\fB\-\fR|\fIaddress\fR|\fBdetect\fR}
.RS 4
The IP address of the provider\*(Aqs gateway router\&.
.sp
You can enter "detect" here and Shorewall will attempt to detect the gateway automatically\&.
.sp
For PPP devices, you may omit this column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOPTIONS\fR (Optional) \- [\fB\-\fR|\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fIoption\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list selected from the following\&. The order of the options is not significant but the list may contain no embedded whitespace\&.
.PP
\fBtrack\fR
.RS 4
If specified, inbound connections on this interface are to be tracked so that responses may be routed back out this same interface\&.
.sp
You want to specify
\fBtrack\fR
if internet hosts will be connecting to local servers through this provider\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.3,
\fBtrack\fR
defaults to the setting of the TRACK_PROVIDERS option in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2
(5)\&. If you set TRACK_PROVIDERS=Yes and want to override that setting for an individual provider, then specify
\fBnotrack\fR
(see below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbalance[=\fR\fB\fIweight\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.RS 4
The providers that have
\fBbalance\fR
specified will get outbound traffic load\-balanced among them\&. By default, all interfaces with
\fBbalance\fR
specified will have the same weight (1)\&. You can change the weight of an interface by specifying
\fBbalance=\fR\fIweight\fR
where
\fIweight\fR
is the weight of the route out of this interface\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBloose\fR
.RS 4
Shorewall normally adds a routing rule for each IP address on an interface which forces traffic whose source is that IP address to be sent using the routing table for that interface\&. Setting
\fBloose\fR
prevents creation of such rules on this interface\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnotrack\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.3\&. When specified, turns off
\fBtrack\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoptional (deprecated)\fR
.RS 4
If the interface named in the INTERFACE column is not up and configured with an IPv4 address then ignore this provider\&. If not specified, the value of the
\fBoptional\fR
option for the INTERFACE in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
is assumed\&. Use of that option is preferred to this one\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsrc=\fR\fIsource\-address\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the source address to use when routing to this provider and none is known (the local client has bound to the 0 address)\&. May not be specified when an
\fIaddress\fR
is given in the INTERFACE column\&. If this option is not used, Shorewall substitutes the primary IP address on the interface named in the INTERFACE column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmtu=\fR\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the MTU when forwarding through this provider\&. If not given, the MTU of the interface named in the INTERFACE column is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfallback[=\fR\fB\fIweight\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.RS 4
Indicates that a default route through the provider should be added to the default routing table (table 253)\&. If a
\fIweight\fR
is given, a balanced route is added with the weight of this provider equal to the specified
\fIweight\fR\&. If the option is given without a
\fIweight\fR, an separate default route is added through the provider\*(Aqs gateway; the route has a metric equal to the provider\*(Aqs NUMBER\&. The option is ignored with a warning message if USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes in
shorewall\&.conf\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBCOPY\fR \- [{\fBnone\fR|\fIinterface\fR\fB[,\fR\fIinterface\fR]\&.\&.\&.}]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of other interfaces on your firewall\&. Wildcards specified using an asterisk ("*") are permitted (e\&.g\&., tun* )\&. Usually used only when DUPLICATE is
\fBmain\fR\&. Only copy routes through INTERFACE and through interfaces listed here\&. If you only wish to copy routes through INTERFACE, enter
\fBnone\fR
in this column\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Example 1:
.RS 4
You run squid in your DMZ on IP address 192\&.168\&.2\&.99\&. Your DMZ interface is eth2
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        #NAME   NUMBER  MARK DUPLICATE  INTERFACE GATEWAY       OPTIONS
        Squid   1       1    \-          eth2      192\&.168\&.2\&.99  \-

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
Example 2:
.RS 4
eth0 connects to ISP 1\&. The IP address of eth0 is 206\&.124\&.146\&.176 and the ISP\*(Aqs gateway router has IP address 206\&.124\&.146\&.254\&.
.sp
eth1 connects to ISP 2\&. The IP address of eth1 is 130\&.252\&.99\&.27 and the ISP\*(Aqs gateway router has IP address 130\&.252\&.99\&.254\&.
.sp
eth2 connects to a local network\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        #NAME NUMBER MARK DUPLICATE INTERFACE GATEWAY          OPTIONS            COPY
