shorewall6.conf \- Shorewall6 global configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 32
\fB/etc/shorewall6/shorewall6\&.conf\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file sets options that apply to Shorewall6 as a whole\&.
.PP
The file consists of Shell comments (lines beginning with \'#\'), blank lines and assignment statements (\fIvariable\fR=\fIvalue\fR)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Many options have as their value a
\fIlog\-level\fR\&. Log levels are a method of describing to syslog (8) the importance of a message and a number of parameters in this file have log levels as their value\&.
.PP
These levels are defined by syslog and are used to determine the destination of the messages through entries in /etc/syslog\&.conf (5)\&. The syslog documentation refers to these as "priorities"; Netfilter calls them "levels" and Shorewall6 also uses that term\&.
.PP
Valid levels are:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
       7       debug
       6       info
       5       notice

       3       err

       1       alert
       0       emerg

.RE
.PP
For most Shorewall6 logging, a level of 6 (info) is appropriate\&. Shorewall6 log messages are generated by NetFilter and are logged using facility \'kern\' and the level that you specifify\&. If you are unsure of the level to choose, 6 (info) is a safe bet\&. You may specify levels by name or by number\&.
.PP
If you have built your kernel with NFLOG target support, you may also specify a log level of NFLOG (must be all caps)\&. Rather than log its messages to syslogd, Shorewall6 will direct netfilter to log the messages via the NFLOG target which will send them to a process called \'ulogd\'\&. ulogd is available with most Linux distributions (although it probably isn\'t installed by default)\&. Ulogd is also available from
\fIhttp://www\&.netfilter\&.org/projects/ulogd/index\&.html\fR
and can be configured to log all Shorewall6 message to their own log file
.PP
The following options may be set in shorewall6\&.conf\&.

.RS 4
To allow for default rules to be applied when USE_ACTIONS=No, the DROP_DEFAULT, REJECT_DEFAULT, ACCEPT_DEFAULT, QUEUE_DEFAULT and NFQUEUE_DEFAULT options have been added\&.
.sp
DROP_DEFAULT describes the rules to be applied before a connection request is dropped by a DROP policy; REJECT_DEFAULT describes the rules to be applied if a connection request is rejected by a REJECT policy\&. The other three are similar for ACCEPT, QUEUE and NFQUEUE policies\&.
.sp
The value applied to these may be:
.IP "" 4
a) The name of an
            \fIaction\fR\&.
.IP "" 4
b) The name of a \fImacro\fR
            (Shorewall6\-shell only)
.IP "" 4
c) \fBNone\fR or \fBnone\fR

.IP "" 4
DROP_DEFAULT="Drop"
.IP "" 4
REJECT_DEFAULT="Reject"
.IP "" 4
ACCEPT_DEFAULT="none"
.IP "" 4
QUEUE_DEFAULT="none"
.IP "" 4
NFQUEUE_DEFAULT="None"
If USE_ACTIONS=Yes, then these values refer to action\&.Drop and action\&.Reject respectively\&. If USE_ACTIONS=No, then these values refer to macro\&.Drop and macro\&.Reject\&.
.sp
If you set the value of either option to "None" then no default action will be used and the default action or macro must be specified in
\fIshorewall6\-policy\fR\&[1](5)\&.
.RE

The value of this variable affects Shorewall6\'s stopped state\&. When ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No, only traffic to/from those addresses listed in
\fIshorewall6\-routestopped\fR\&[2](5) is accepted when Shorewall6 is stopped\&. When ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes, in addition to traffic to/from addresses in
\fIshorewall6\-routestopped\fR\&[2](5), connections that were active when Shorewall6 stopped continue to work and all new connections from the firewall system itself are allowed\&. If this variable is not set or is given the empty value then ADMINISABSENTMINDED=No is assumed\&.

This parameter determines the disposition of packets from blacklisted hosts\&. It may have the value DROP if the packets are to be dropped or REJECT if the packets are to be replied with an ICMP port unreachable reply or a TCP RST (tcp only)\&. If you do not assign a value or if you assign an empty value then DROP is assumed\&.
.RE

\fBCLAMPMSS=[\fR\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR|\fIvalue\fR]
.RS 4
This parameter enables the TCP Clamp MSS to PMTU feature of Netfilter and is usually required when your internet connection is through PPPoE or PPTP\&. If set to
\fBYes\fR
or
\fByes\fR, the feature is enabled\&. If left blank or set to
\fBNo\fR
or
\fBno\fR, the feature is not enabled\&.
.sp
\fBImportant\fR: This option requires CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS in your kernel\&.
.sp
You may also set CLAMPMSS to a numeric
\fIvalue\fR
(e\&.g\&., CLAMPMSS=1400)\&. This will set the MSS field in TCP SYN packets going through the firewall to the

\fBCLEAR_TC=\fR[\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR]
.RS 4
If this option is set to
\fBNo\fR
then Shorewall6 won\'t clear the current traffic control rules during [re]start\&. This setting is intended for use by people that prefer to configure traffic shaping when the network interfaces come up rather than when the firewall is started\&. If that is what you want to do, set TC_ENABLED=Yes and CLEAR_TC=No and do not supply an /etc/shorewall6/tcstart file\&. That way, your traffic shaping rules can still use the \(lqfwmark\(rq classifier based on packet marking defined in
\fIshorewall6\-tcrules\fR\&[3](5)\&. If not specified, CLEAR_TC=No is assumed\&.

\fBCONFIG_PATH\fR=[\fIdirectory\fR[:\fIdirectory\fR]\&.\&.\&.]

If CONFIG_PATH is not given or if it is set to the empty value then the contents of /usr/share/shorewall6/configpath are used\&. As released from shorewall\&.net, that file sets the CONFIG_PATH to /etc/shorewall6:/usr/share/shorewall6:/usr/share/shorewall but your particular distribution may set it differently\&. See the output of shorewall6 show config for the default on your system\&.

\fBDELETE_THEN_ADD=\fR{\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR}
.RS 4
If set to Yes (the default value), entries in the /etc/shorewall6/route_stopped files cause an \'ip rule del\' command to be generated in addition to an \'ip rule add\' command\&. Setting this option to No, causes the \'ip rule del\' command to be omitted\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBEXPAND_POLICIES=\fR{\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR}
.RS 4
Normally, when the SOURCE or DEST columns in shorewall6\-policy(5) contains \'all\', a single policy chain is created and the policy is enforced in that chain\&. For example, if the policy entry is
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
#SOURCE DEST POLICY LOG
#                   LEVEL
net     all  DROP   info
.fi
.RE
.sp
then the chain name is \'net2all\' which is also the chain named in Shorewall6 log messages generated as a result of the policy\&. If EXPAND_POLICIES=Yes, then Shorewall6 will create a separate chain for each pair of zones covered by the policy\&. This makes the resulting log messages easier to interpret since the chain in the messages will have a name of the form \'a2b\' where \'a\' is the SOURCE zone and \'b\' is the DEST zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBEXPORTPARAMS=\fR{\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR}
.RS 4
It is quite difficult to code a \'params\' file that assigns other than constant values such that it works correctly with Shorewall6 Lite\&. The EXPORTPARAMS option works around this problem\&. When EXPORTPARAMS=No, the \'params\' file is not copied to the compiler output\&.
.sp
With EXPORTPARAMS=No, if you need to set environmental variables on the firewall system for use by your extension scripts, then do so in the init extension script\&.
.sp
The default is EXPORTPARAMS=Yes
.RE
.PP
\fBFASTACCEPT=\fR{\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR}
.RS 4
Normally, Shorewall6 defers accepting ESTABLISHED/RELATED packets until these packets reach the chain in which the original connection was accepted\&. So for packets going from the \'loc\' zone to the \'net\' zone, ESTABLISHED/RELATED packets are ACCEPTED in the \'loc2net\' chain\&.
.sp
If you set FASTACCEPT=Yes, then ESTABLISHED/RELEATED packets are accepted early in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains\&. If you set FASTACCEPT=Yes then you may not include rules in the ESTABLISHED or RELATED sections of
\fIshorewall6\-rules\fR\&[5](5)\&.

\fBIMPLICIT_CONTINUE=\fR{\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR}
.RS 4
When this option is set to
\fBYes\fR, it causes subzones to be treated differently with respect to policies\&.
.sp
Subzones are defined by following their name with ":" and a list of parent zones (in
\fIshorewall6\-zones\fR\&[6](5))\&. Normally, you want to have a set of special rules for the subzone and if a connection doesn\'t match any of those subzone\-specific rules then you want the parent zone rules and policies to be applied; see
\fIshorewall6\-nesting\fR\&[7](5)\&. With IMPLICIT_CONTINUE=Yes, that happens automatically\&.
.sp
If IMPLICIT_CONTINUE=No or if IMPLICIT_CONTINUE is not set, then subzones are not subject to this special treatment\&. With IMPLICIT_CONTINUE=Yes, an implicit CONTINUE policy may be overridden by including an explicit policy (one that does not specify "all" in either the SOURCE or the DEST columns)\&.

The OPTIMIZE setting also controls the suppression of redundant wildcard rules (those specifying "all" in the SOURCE or DEST column)\&. A wildcard rule is considered to be redundant when it has the same ACTION and Log Level as the applicable policy\&.

Eariler generations of Shorewall6 Lite required that remote root login via ssh be enabled in order to use the
\fBload\fR
and
\fBreload\fR
commands\&. Beginning with release 3\&.9\&.5, you may define an alternative means for accessing the remote firewall system\&. In that release, two new options were added to shorewall6\&.conf:.IP "" 4
RSH_COMMAND
.IP "" 4
RCP_COMMAND
The default values for these are as follows:.IP "" 4
RSH_COMMAND: ssh ${root}@${system} ${command}
.IP "" 4
RCP_COMMAND: scp ${files}
              ${root}@${system}:${destination}
Shell variables that will be set when the commands are envoked are as follows:.IP "" 4
\fIroot\fR \- root user\&. Normally
              \fBroot\fR but may be overridden using the \'\-r\'
              option\&.
.IP "" 4
\fIsystem\fR \- The name/IP address
              of the remote firewall system\&.
.IP "" 4
\fIcommand\fR \- For RSH_COMMAND,
