The order of entries in this file is important
.PP
This file determines what to do with a new connection request if we don\*(Aqt get a match from the /etc/shorewall6/rules file \&. For each source/destination pair, the file is processed in order until a match is found ("all" will match any client or server)\&.

Intra\-zone policies are pre\-defined
.PP
For $FW and for all of the zones defined in /etc/shorewall6/zones, the POLICY for connections from the zone to itself is ACCEPT (with no logging or TCP connection rate limiting but may be overridden by an entry in this file\&. The overriding entry must be explicit (cannot use "all" in the SOURCE or DEST)\&.
.PP
Similarly, if you have IMPLICIT_CONTINUE=Yes in shorewall6\&.conf, then the implicit policy to/from any sub\-zone is CONTINUE\&. These implicit CONTINUE policies may also be overridden by an explicit entry in this file\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBSOURCE\fR \- \fIzone\fR|\fB$FW\fR|\fBall\fR
.RS 4
Source zone\&. Must be the name of a zone defined in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5), $FW or "all"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDEST\fR \- \fIzone\fR|\fB$FW\fR|\fBall\fR
.RS 4
Destination zone\&. Must be the name of a zone defined in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5), $FW or "all"\&. If the DEST is a bport zone, then the SOURCE must be "all", another bport zone associated with the same bridge, or it must be an ipv6 zone that is associated with only the same bridge\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPOLICY\fR \- {\fBACCEPT\fR|\fBDROP\fR|\fBREJECT\fR|\fBCONTINUE\fR|\fBQUEUE\fR|\fBNFQUEUE\fR[(\fIqueuenumber\fR)]|\fBNONE\fR}[\fB:\fR{\fIdefault\-action\-or\-macro\fR|\fBNone\fR}]
.RS 4
Policy if no match from the rules file is found\&.
.sp
If the policy is other than CONTINUE or NONE then the policy may be followed by ":" and one of the following:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
The word "None" or "none"\&. This causes any default action defined in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) to be omitted for this policy\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
The name of an action (requires that USE_ACTIONS=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5))\&. That action will be invoked before the policy is enforced\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
The name of a macro\&. The rules in that macro will be applied before the policy is enforced\&. This does not require USE_ACTIONS=Yes\&.
.RE

.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf

.sp
Possible policies are:
.PP
\fBACCEPT\fR
.RS 4
Accept the connection\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDROP\fR
.RS 4
Ignore the connection request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREJECT\fR
.RS 4
For TCP, send RST\&. For all other, send an "unreachable" ICMP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBQUEUE\fR
.RS 4
Queue the request for a user\-space application such as Snort\-inline\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFQUEUE\fR
.RS 4
Queue the request for a user\-space application using the nfnetlink_queue mechanism\&. If a
\fIqueuenumber\fR
is not given, queue zero (0) is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE\fR
.RS 4
Pass the connection request past any other rules that it might also match (where the source or destination zone in those rules is a superset of the SOURCE or DEST in this policy)\&. See
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-nesting\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5) for additional information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNONE\fR
.RS 4
Assume that there will never be any packets from this SOURCE to this DEST\&. shorewall6 will not create any infrastructure to handle such packets and you may not have any rules with this SOURCE and DEST in the /etc/shorewall6/rules file\&. If such a packet
\fBis\fR
received, the result is undefined\&. NONE may not be used if the SOURCE or DEST columns contain the firewall zone ($FW) or "all"\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBLOG LEVEL\fR (Optional) \- [\fIlog\-level\fR|\fBNFLOG\fR]
.RS 4
If supplied, each connection handled under the default POLICY is logged at that level\&. If not supplied, no log message is generated\&. See syslog\&.conf(5) for a description of log levels\&.
.sp
You may also specify NFLOG (must be in upper case)\&. This will log to the NFLOG target and will send to a separate log through use of ulogd (\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.netfilter\&.org/projects/ulogd/index\&.html\fR\m[])\&.
.sp
If you don\*(Aqt want to log but need to specify the following column, place "\-" here\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBBURST:LIMIT\fR \- [{\fIs\fR|\fBd\fR}:[[\fIname\fR]:]]]\fIrate\fR\fB/\fR{\fBsecond\fR|\fBminute\fR}[:\fIburst\fR]
.RS 4
If passed, specifies the maximum TCP connection
\fIrate\fR
and the size of an acceptable
\fIburst\fR\&. If not specified, TCP connections are not limited\&. If the
\fIburst\fR
parameter is omitted, a value of 5 is assumed\&.
.sp
When
\fBs:\fR
or
\fBd:\fR
is specified, the rate applies per source IP address or per destination IP address respectively\&. The
\fIname\fR
may be chosen by the user and specifies a hash table to be used to count matching connections\&. If not give, the name
\fBshorewall\fR
is assumed\&. Where more than one POLICY specifies the same name, the connections counts for the policies are aggregated and the individual rates apply to the aggregated count\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONNLIMIT\fR \- \fIlimit\fR[:\fImask\fR]
.RS 4
May be used to limit the number of simultaneous connections from each individual host to
\fIlimit\fR
connections\&. While the limit is only checked on connections to which this policy could apply, the number of current connections is calculated over all current connections from the SOURCE host\&. By default, the limit is applied to each host individually but can be made to apply to networks of hosts by specifying a
\fImask\fR\&. The
\fImask\fR
specifies the width of a VLSM mask to be applied to the source address; the number of current connections is then taken over all hosts in the subnet
\fIsource\-address\fR/\fImask\fR\&.
