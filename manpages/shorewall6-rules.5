.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Entries in this file govern connection establishment by defining exceptions to the policies laid out in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-policy\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)\&. By default, subsequent requests and responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking\&. For any particular (source,dest) pair of zones, the rules are evaluated in the order in which they appear in this file and the first terminating match is the one that determines the disposition of the request\&. All rules are terminating except LOG and QUEUE rules\&.
.PP
The rules file is divided into sections\&. Each section is introduced by a "Section Header" which is a line beginning with SECTION and followed by the section name\&.
.PP
Sections are as follows and must appear in the order listed:
.PP
\fBALL\fR
.RS 4
This section was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.23\&. rules in this section are applied, regardless of the connection tracking state of the packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBESTABLISHED\fR
.RS 4
Packets in the ESTABLISHED state are processed by rules in this section\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBINVALID\fR
.RS 4

\fBRELATED\fR
sections must be empty\&.
.PP
An except is made if you are running Shorewall 4\&.4\&.27 or later and you have specified a non\-default value for RELATED_DISPOSITION or RELATED_LOG_LEVEL\&. In that case, you may have rules in the RELATED section of this file\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
You may omit any section that you don\*(Aqt need\&. If no Section Headers appear in the file then all rules are assumed to be in the NEW section\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate specification syntax)\&.
.PP
\fBACTION\fR \- \fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB[:\fR{\fIlog\-level\fR|\fBnone\fR}[\fB\fB!\fR\fR][\fB:\fR\fItag\fR]]
.RS 4
Specifies the action to be taken if the connection request matches the rule\&.
\fItarget\fR
must be one of the following\&.
.PP
\fBACCEPT\fR
.RS 4
Allow the connection request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBACCEPT+\fR
.RS 4
like ACCEPT but also excludes the connection from any subsequent matching
\fBDNAT\fR[\fB\-\fR] or
\fBREDIRECT\fR[\fB\-\fR] rules\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBACCEPT!\fR
.RS 4
like ACCEPT but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIaction\fR
.RS 4
The name of an
\fIaction\fR
declared in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5) or in /usr/share/shorewall/actions\&.std\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBADD(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes addresses and/or port numbers to be added to the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be added to the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be added using
\fIflags\fR
\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-A command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
ADD is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
AUDIT[(accept|drop|reject)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.10\&. Audits the packet with the specified type; if the type is omitted, then
\fBdrop\fR
is assumed\&. Require AUDIT_TARGET support in the kernel and iptables\&.
.RE
.PP
A_ACCEPT, and A_ACCEPT!
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20\&. Audited versions of ACCEPT and ACCEPT! respectively\&. Require AUDIT_TARGET support in the kernel and iptables\&.
.RE
.PP
A_DROP and A_DROP!
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
A_REJECT AND A_REJECT!
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB[?]COMMENT\fR
.RS 4
the rest of the line will be attached as a comment to the Netfilter rule(s) generated by the following entries\&. The comment will appear delimited by "/* \&.\&.\&. */" in the output of "shorewall show <chain>"\&. To stop the comment from being attached to further rules, simply include COMMENT on a line by itself\&.

.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE\fR
.RS 4
For experts only\&.
.sp
Do not process any of the following rules for this (source zone,destination zone)\&. If the source and/or destination IP address falls into a zone defined later in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5) or in a parent zone of the source or destination zones, then this connection request will be passed to the rules defined for that (those) zone(s)\&. See
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-nesting\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2(5) for additional information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE!\fR
.RS 4
like CONTINUE but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCOUNT\fR
.RS 4
Simply increment the rule\*(Aqs packet and byte count and pass the packet to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDEL(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes an entry to be deleted from the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be deleted from the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be deleted using
\fIflags\fR
\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-D command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
DEL is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDNAT\fR
.RS 4
Forward the request to another system (and optionally another port)\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDNAT\-\fR
.RS 4
Advanced users only\&.
.sp
Like
\fBDNAT\fR
but only generates the
\fBDNAT\fR
iptables rule and not the companion
\fBACCEPT\fR
rule\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDROP\fR
.RS 4
Ignore the request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDROP!\fR
.RS 4
like DROP but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
HELPER
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.7\&. This action requires that the HELPER column contains the name of the Netfilter helper to be associated with connections matching this connection\&. May only be specified in the NEW section and is useful for being able to specify a helper when the applicable policy is ACCEPT\&. No destination zone should be specified in HELPER rules\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINLINE\fR[(\fIaction\fR)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16\&. This action allows you to construct most of the rule yourself using ip6tables syntax\&. The part that you specify must follow a semicolon (\*(Aq;\*(Aq) and is completely free\-form\&. If the target of the rule (the part following \*(Aqj\*(Aq) is something that Shorewall supports in the ACTION column, then you may enclose it in parentheses (e\&.g\&., INLINE(ACCEPT))\&. Otherwise, you can include it after the semicolon\&. In this case, you must declare the target as a builtin action in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Some considerations when using INLINE:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The
\fBp\fR,
\fBs\fR,
\fBd\fR,
\fBi\fR,
\fBo\fR,
\fBpolicy\fR, and state match (\fBstate\fR
or
\fBconntrack \-\-ctstate\fR) matches will always appear in the front of the rule in that order\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
When multiple matches are specified, the compiler will keep them in the order in which they appear (excluding the above listed ones), but they will not necessarily be at the end of the generated rule\&. For example, if addresses are specified in the SOURCE and/or DEST columns, their generated matches will appear after those specified using \*(Aq;\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBLOG:\fR\fB\fIlevel\fR\fR
.RS 4
Simply log the packet and continue with the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fImacro\fR\fB[(\fR\fB\fImacrotarget\fR\fR\fB)]\fR
.RS 4
The name of a macro defined in a file named macro\&.\fImacro\fR\&. If the macro accepts an action parameter (Look at the macro source to see if it has PARAM in the TARGET column) then the
\fImacro\fR
name is followed by the parenthesized
\fImacrotarget\fR
(\fBACCEPT\fR,
\fBDROP\fR,
\fBREJECT\fR, \&.\&.\&.) to be substituted for the parameter\&.
.sp
Example: FTP(ACCEPT)\&.
.sp
The older syntax where the macro name and the target are separated by a slash (e\&.g\&. FTP/ACCEPT) is still allowed but is deprecated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFLOG\fR[(\fInflog\-parameters\fR)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.9\&.3\&. Queues matching packets to a back end logging daemon via a netlink socket then continues to the next rule\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/shorewall_logging\&.html\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Similar to\fB LOG:NFLOG\fR[(\fInflog\-parameters\fR)], except that the log level is not changed when this ACTION is used in an action or macro and the invocation of that action or macro specifies a log level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFQUEUE\fR[(\fIqueuenumber\fR)]
.RS 4
Queues the packet to a user\-space application using the nfnetlink_queue mechanism\&. If a
\fIqueuenumber\fR
is not specified, queue zero (0) is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFQUEUE![(\fR\fB\fIqueuenumber\fR\fR\fB)]\fR
.RS 4
like NFQUEUE but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNONAT\fR
.RS 4
Excludes the connection from any subsequent
\fBDNAT\fR[\-] or
\fBREDIRECT\fR[\-] rules but doesn\*(Aqt generate a rule to accept the traffic\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBQUEUE\fR
.RS 4
Queue the packet to a user\-space application such as ftwall (http://p2pwall\&.sf\&.net)\&. The application may reinsert the packet for further processing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBQUEUE!\fR
.RS 4
like QUEUE but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREDIRECT\fR
.RS 4
Redirect the request to a server running on the firewall\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREDIRECT\-\fR
.RS 4
Advanced users only\&.
.sp
Like
\fBREDIRECT\fR
but only generates the
\fBREDIRECT\fR
iptables rule and not the companion
\fBACCEPT\fR
rule\&. Requires Shorewall 4\&.5\&.14 or later\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREJECT\fR
.RS 4
disallow the request and return an icmp\-unreachable or an RST packet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREJECT!\fR
.RS 4
like REJECT but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.sp
The
\fItarget\fR
may optionally be followed by ":" and a syslog log level (e\&.g, REJECT:info or Web(ACCEPT):debug)\&. This causes the packet to be logged at the specified level\&. Note that if the
\fBACTION\fR
involves destination network address translation (DNAT, REDIRECT, etc\&.) then the packet is logged
\fBbefore\fR
the destination address is rewritten\&.
.sp
If the
\fBACTION\fR
names an
\fIaction\fR
declared in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[7]\d\s+2(5) or in /usr/share/shorewall/actions\&.std then:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the log level is followed by "!\*(Aq then all rules in the action are logged at the log level\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the log level is not followed by "!" then only those rules in the action that do not specify logging are logged at the specified level\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The special log level
\fBnone!\fR
suppresses logging by the action\&.
.RE
.sp
You may also specify
\fBULOG\fR
or
\fBNFLOG\fR
(must be in upper case) as a log level\&.This will log to the ULOG or NFLOG target for routing to a separate log through use of ulogd (\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.netfilter\&.org/projects/ulogd/index\&.html\fR\m[])\&.
.sp
Actions specifying logging may be followed by a log tag (a string of alphanumeric characters) which is appended to the string generated by the LOGPREFIX (in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[8]\d\s+2(5))\&.
.sp
Example: ACCEPT:info:ftp would include \*(Aqftp \*(Aq at the end of the log prefix generated by the LOGPREFIX setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSOURCE\fR \- {\fIzone\fR|\fIzone\-list\fR[+]|\fB{all|any}\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR]}\fB[:\fR\fIinterface\fR][\fB:\fR\fB\fB<\fR\fR{\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR[,\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR]\&.\&.\&.[\fIexclusion\fR]\fB>\fR|\fIexclusion\fR|\fB+\fR\fIipset\fR|\fI^countrycode\-list\fR}
.RS 4
Source hosts to which the rule applies\&. May be a zone declared in /etc/shorewall6/zones,
\fB$FW\fR
to indicate the firewall itself,
\fBall\fR,
\fBall+\fR,
\fBall\-\fR,
\fBall+\-\fR
or
\fBnone\fR\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13, you may use a
\fIzone\-list \fRwhich consists of a comma\-separated list of zones declared in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[9]\d\s+2
(5)\&. This
\fIzone\-list\fR
may be optionally followed by "+" to indicate that the rule is to apply to intra\-zone traffic as well as inter\-zone traffic\&.
.sp
When
\fBnone\fR
is used either in the
\fBSOURCE\fR
or
\fBDEST\fR
column, the rule is ignored\&.
.sp
\fBall\fR
means "All Zones", including the firewall itself\&.
\fBall\-\fR
means "All Zones, except the firewall itself"\&. When
\fBall\fR[\fB\-\fR] is used either in the
\fBSOURCE\fR
or
\fBDEST\fR
column intra\-zone traffic is not affected\&. When
\fBall+\fR[\fB\-\fR] is "used, intra\-zone traffic is affected\&. Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13, exclusion is supported \-\- see see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-exclusion\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Except when
\fBall\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] or
\fBany\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] is specified, clients may be further restricted to a list of networks and/or hosts by appending ":" and a comma\-separated list of network and/or host addresses\&. Hosts may be specified by IP or MAC address; mac addresses must begin with "~" and must use "\-" as a separator\&.
.sp
\fBany\fR
is equivalent to
\fBall\fR
when there are no nested zones\&. When there are nested zones,
\fBany\fR
only refers to top\-level zones (those with no parent zones)\&. Note that
\fBany\fR
excludes all vserver zones, since those zones are nested within the firewall zone\&.
.sp
Hosts may also be specified as an IP address range using the syntax
\fIlowaddress\fR\-\fIhighaddress\fR\&. This requires that your kernel and ip6tables contain iprange match support\&. If your kernel and ip6tables have ipset match support then you may give the name of an ipset prefaced by "+"\&. The ipset name may be optionally followed by a number from 1 to 6 enclosed in square brackets ([]) to indicate the number of levels of source bindings to be matched\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall6 4\&.4\&.17, the primary IP address of a firewall interface can be specified by an ampersand (\*(Aq&\*(Aq) followed by the logical name of the interface as found in the INTERFACE column of
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[11]\d\s+2
(5)\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.5\&.4, A
\fIcountrycode\-list\fR
may be specified\&. A countrycode\-list is a comma\-separated list of up to 15 two\-character ISO\-3661 country codes enclosed in square brackets (\*(Aq[\&.\&.\&.]\*(Aq) and preceded by a caret (\*(Aq^\*(Aq)\&. When a single country code is given, the square brackets may be omitted\&. A list of country codes supported by Shorewall may be found at
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/ISO\-3661\&.html\fR\m[]\&. Specifying a
\fIcountrycode\-list\fR
requires
GeoIP Match
support in your ip6tables and Kernel\&.
.sp
When an
\fIinterface\fR
is not specified, you may omit the angled brackets (\*(Aq<\*(Aq and \*(Aq>\*(Aq) around the address(es) or you may supply them to improve readability\&.
.sp
You may exclude certain hosts from the set already defined through use of an
\fIexclusion\fR
(see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-exclusion\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2(5))\&.

Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface by appending ":" to the zone name followed by the interface name\&. For example,
\fBloc:eth1\fR
specifies a client that communicates with the firewall system through eth1\&. This may be optionally followed by another colon (":") and an IP/MAC/subnet address as described above (e\&.g\&.,

You want to generate your own rule involving ip6tables targets and matches not supported by Shorewall\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        #ACTION                       SOURCE           DEST           PROTO       DEST
        #                                                                         PORT(S)
        INLINE                        $FW              net ; \-p 6 \-m mickey\-mouse \-\-name test \-m set \-\-match\-set set1 src \-m mickey\-mouse \-\-name test2 \-j SECCTX \-\-name test3
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The above will generate the following ip6tables\-restore input:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        \-A fw2net \-p 6 \-m mickey\-mouse \-\-name test \-m set \-\-match\-set set1 src \-m mickey\-mouse \-\-name test2 \-j SECCTX \-\-name test3
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that SECCTX must be defined as a builtin action in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5):
