.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file lists the interfaces that are subject to simple traffic shaping\&. Simple traffic shaping is enabled by setting TC_ENABLED=Simple in
\fIshorewall\&.conf\fR\&[1](5)\&.

The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR
.RS 4
The logical name of an interface\&. If you run both IPv4 and IPv6 Shorewall firewalls, a given interface should only be listed in one of the two configurations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTYPE\fR \- [\fBexternal\fR|\fBinternal\fR]
.RS 4
Optional\&. If given specifies whether the interface is
\fBexternal\fR
(facing toward the Internet) or
\fBinternal\fR
(facing toward a local network) and enables SFQ flow classification\&.

Note
Simple traffic shaping is only useful on interfaces where queuing occurs\&. As a consequence, internal interfaces seldom benefit from simple traffic shaping\&. VPN interfaces are an exception because the encapsulated packets are later transferred over a slower external link\&.
.RE
.PP
IN\-BANDWIDTH \- [\fIrate\fR]
.RS 4
Optional\&. If specified, enables ingress policing on the interface\&. If incoming traffic exceeds the given
\fIrate\fR, received packets are dropped randomly\&. With some DSL and Cable links, large queues can build up in the ISP\'s gateway router\&. While this insures maximum throughput, it kills interactive response time\&. By setting IN\-BANDWIDTH, you can eliminate these queues\&.
.sp
To pick an appropriate setting, we recommend that you start by setting it significantly below your measured download bandwidth (20% or so)\&. While downloading, measure the ping response time from the firewall to the upstream router as you gradually increase the setting\&.The optimal setting is at the point beyond which the ping time increases sharply as you increase the setting\&.
