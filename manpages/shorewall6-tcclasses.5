if you want the values to be calculated for you depending on the output bandwidth setting defined for an interface in tcdevices, you can use expressions like the following:
.PP
full/3
.RS 4
causes the bandwidth to be calculated as 1/3 of the full outgoing speed that is defined\&.
.RE
.PP
full*9/10
.RS 4
will set this bandwidth to 9/10 of the full bandwidth
.RE
.sp
Note that in a sub\-class (a class that has a specified parent class), full refers to the RATE or CEIL of the parent class rather than to the OUT\-BANDWIDTH of the device\&.
.sp
DO NOT add a unit to the rate if it is calculated !
.RE
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR[[:\fIparent\fR]:\fIclass\fR]
.RS 4
Name of
\fIinterface\fR\&. Each interface may be listed only once in this file\&. You may NOT specify the name of an alias (e\&.g\&., eth0:0) here; see
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/FAQ\&.htm#faq18\fR\m[]
.sp
You may specify either the interface number or the interface name\&. If the
\fBclassify\fR
option is given for the interface in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5), then you must also specify an interface class (an integer that must be unique within classes associated with this interface)\&.
.sp
You may NOT specify wildcards here, e\&.g\&. if you have multiple ppp interfaces, you need to put them all in here!
.sp
Please note that you can only use interface names in here that have a bandwidth defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5) file\&.
.sp
Normally, all classes defined here are sub\-classes of a root class (class number 1) that is implicitly defined from the entry in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)\&. You can establish a class hierarchy by specifying a
\fIparent\fR
class \-\- the number of a class that you have previously defined\&. The sub\-class may borrow unused bandwidth from its parent\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMARK\fR \- {\-|\fIvalue\fR}
.RS 4
The mark
\fIvalue\fR
which is an integer in the range 1\-255\&. You set mark values in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcrules\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) file, marking the traffic you want to fit in the classes defined in here\&. Must be specified as \*(Aq\-\*(Aq if the
\fBclassify\fR
option is given for the interface in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)
.sp
You can use the same marks for different interfaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRATE\fR \- \fIrate\fR[:\fIdmax\fR[:\fIumax\fR]]
.RS 4
The minimum bandwidth this class should get, when the traffic load rises\&. If the sum of the rates in this column exceeds the INTERFACE\*(Aqs OUT\-BANDWIDTH, then the OUT\-BANDWIDTH limit may not be honored\&. Similarly, if the sum of the rates of sub\-classes of a class exceed the CEIL of the parent class, things don\*(Aqt work well\&.
.sp
When using the HFSC queuing discipline, leaf classes may specify
\fIdmax\fR, the maximum delay in milliseconds that the first queued packet for this class should experience\&. May be expressed as an integer, optionally followed by \*(Aqms\*(Aq with no intervening white space (e\&.g\&., 10ms)\&.
.sp
HFSC leaf classes may also specify
\fIumax\fR, the largest packet expected in this class\&. May be expressed as an integer\&. The unit of measure is
\fIbytes\fR
and the integer may be optionally followed by \*(Aqb\*(Aq with no intervening white space (e\&.g\&., 800b)\&.
\fIumax\fR
may only be given if
\fIdmax\fR
is also given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCEIL\fR \- \fIrate\fR
.RS 4
The maximum bandwidth this class is allowed to use when the link is idle\&. Useful if you have traffic which can get full speed when more needed services (e\&.g\&. ssh) are not used\&.
.sp
You can use the value
\fBfull\fR
in here for setting the maximum bandwidth to the RATE of the parent class, or the OUT\-BANDWIDTH of the device if there is no parent class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPRIORITY\fR \- \fIpriority\fR
.RS 4
The
\fIpriority\fR
in which classes will be serviced by the packet shaping scheduler and also the priority in which bandwidth in excess of the rate will be given to each class\&.
.sp
Higher priority classes will experience less delay since they are serviced first\&. Priority values are serviced in ascending order (e\&.g\&. 0 is higher priority than 1)\&.
.sp
Classes may be set to the same priority, in which case they will be serviced as equals\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOPTIONS\fR (Optional) \- [\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fIoption\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of options including the following:
.PP
\fBdefault\fR
.RS 4
This is the default class for that interface where all traffic should go, that is not classified otherwise\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}

.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1

You must define
\fBdefault\fR
for exactly one class per interface\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBtos=0x\fR\fIvalue\fR[/0x\fImask\fR] (mask defaults to 0xff)
.RS 4
This lets you define a classifier for the given
\fIvalue\fR/\fImask\fR
combination of the IP packet\*(Aqs TOS/Precedence/DiffSrv octet (aka the TOS byte)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtos\-\fR\fItosname\fR
.RS 4
Aliases for the following TOS octet value and mask encodings\&. TOS encodings of the "TOS byte" have been deprecated in favor of diffserve classes, but programs like ssh, rlogin, and ftp still use them\&.

\fBtcp\-ack\fR

If defined, causes a tc filter to be created that puts all tcp ack packets on that interface that have a size of <=64 Bytes to go in this class\&. This is useful for speeding up downloads\&. Please note that the size of the ack packets is limited to 64 bytes because we want only packets WITHOUT payload to match\&.

.PP
flow=\fIkeys\fR
.RS 4
Shorewall attaches an SFQ queuing discipline to each leaf HTB class\&. SFQ ensures that each
flow
gets equal access to the interface\&. The default definition of a flow corresponds roughly to a Netfilter connection\&. So if one internal system is running BitTorrent, for example, it can have lots of \*(Aqflows\*(Aq and can thus take up a larger share of the bandwidth than a system having only a single active connection\&. The
\fBflow\fR
classifier (module cls_flow) works around this by letting you define what a \*(Aqflow\*(Aq is\&. The clasifier must be used carefully or it can block off all traffic on an interface! The flow option can be specified for an HTB leaf class (one that has no sub\-classes)\&. We recommend that you use the following:
.RS 4
Shaping internet\-bound traffic:
                  flow=nfct\-src
.RE
.RS 4
Shaping traffic bound for your local net:
                  flow=dst
.RE
These will cause a \*(Aqflow\*(Aq to consists of the traffic to/from each internal system\&.
.sp
When more than one key is give, they must be enclosed in parenthesis and separated by commas\&.
.sp
To see a list of the possible flow keys, run this command:
\fBtc filter add flow help\fR
Those that begin with "nfct\-" are Netfilter connection tracking fields\&. As shown above, we recommend flow=nfct\-src; that means that we want to use the source IP address
\fIbefore NAT\fR
as the key\&.
.RE
.PP
pfifo
.RS 4
When specified for a leaf class, the pfifo queing discipline is applied to the class rather than the sfq queuing discipline\&.
.RE
.PP
limit=\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.3\&. When specified for a leaf class, determines the maximum number of packets that may be queued within the class\&. The
\fInumber\fR
must be > 2 and <= 128\&. If not specified, the value 127 is assumed\&.
.RE
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Example 1:
.RS 4
Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL) and ppp0 is the interface for this\&. You have 4 classes here, the first you can use for voice over IP traffic, the second interactive traffic (e\&.g\&. ssh/telnet but not scp), the third will be for all unclassified traffic, and the forth is for low priority traffic (e\&.g\&. peer\-to\-peer)\&.
.sp
The voice traffic in the first class will be guaranteed a minimum of 100kbps and always be serviced first (because of the low priority number, giving less delay) and will be granted excess bandwidth (up to 180kbps, the class ceiling) first, before any other traffic\&. A single VOIP stream, depending upon codecs, after encapsulation, can take up to 80kbps on a PPOE/DSL link, so we pad a little bit just in case\&. (TOS byte values 0xb8 and 0x68 are DiffServ classes EF and AFF3\-1 respectively and are often used by VOIP devices)\&.
.sp
Interactive traffic (tos\-minimum\-delay) and TCP acks (and ICMP echo traffic if you use the example in tcrules) and any packet with a mark of 2 will be guaranteed 1/4 of the link bandwidth, and may extend up to full speed of the link\&.
.sp
Unclassified traffic and packets marked as 3 will be guaranteed 1/4th of the link bandwidth, and may extend to the full speed of the link\&.
.sp
Packets marked with 4 will be treated as low priority packets\&. (The tcrules example marks p2p traffic as such\&.) If the link is congested, they\*(Aqre only guaranteed 1/8th of the speed, and even if the link is empty, can only expand to 80% of link bandwidth just as a precaution in case there are upstream queues we didn\*(Aqt account for\&. This is the last class to get additional bandwidth and the last to get serviced by the scheduler because of the low priority\&.
