.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The shorewall6\-lite utility is used to control the Shoreline Firewall Lite (Shorewall Lite)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fBtrace\fR
and
\fBdebug\fR
options are used for debugging\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall\&.htm#Trace\fR\m[]\&.
.PP
The
\fBnolock\fR
option prevents the command from attempting to acquire the shorewall6\-lite lockfile\&. It is useful if you need to include
\fBshorewall\fR
commands in the
started\m[blue]\fBextension script\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
control the amount of output that the command produces\&. They consist of a sequence of the letters
\fBv\fR
and
\fBq\fR\&. If the options are omitted, the amount of output is determined by the setting of the VERBOSITY parameter in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&. Each
\fBv\fR
adds one to the effective verbosity and each
\fBq\fR
subtracts one from the effective VERBOSITY\&. Alternately,
\fBv\fR
may be followed immediately with one of \-1,0,1,2 to specify VERBOSITY\&. There may be no white\-space between
\fBv\fR
and the VERBOSITY\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
may also include the letter
\fBt\fR
which causes all progress messages to be timestamped\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
The available commands are listed below\&.
.PP
\fBadd \fR{ \fIinterface\fR[:\fIhost\-list\fR]\&.\&.\&. \fIzone\fR | \fIzone\fR \fIhost\-list\fR }
.RS 4
Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN\*(Aqs\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
argument names an interface defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5) file\&. A
\fIhost\-list\fR
is comma\-separated list whose elements are host or network addresses\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBCaution\fR
.ps -1
.br
The
\fBadd\fR
command is not very robust\&. If there are errors in the
\fIhost\-list\fR, you may see a large number of error messages yet a subsequent
\fBshorewall6\-lite show zones\fR
command will indicate that all hosts were added\&. If this happens, replace
\fBadd\fR
by
\fBdelete\fR
and run the same command again\&. Then enter the correct command\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBallow \fR\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Re\-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously blacklisted by a
\fBdrop\fR,
\fBlogdrop\fR,
\fBreject\fR, or
\fBlogreject\fR
command\&. Beginning with Shorewall 5\&.0\&.10, this command can also re\-enable addresses blacklisted using the
\fBblacklist\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBblacklist\fR \fIaddress\fR [ \fIoption\fR \&.\&.\&. ]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.8 and requires DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset\&.\&. in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5)\&. Causes packets from the given host or network
\fIaddress\fR
to be dropped, based on the setting of BLACKLIST in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5)\&. The
\fIaddress\fR
along with any
\fIoption\fRs are passed to the
\fBipset add\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcall \fR\fB\fIfunction\fR\fR\fB [ \fR\fB\fIparameter\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&. ]\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.10\&. Allows you to call a function in one of the Shorewall libraries or in your compiled script\&. function must name the shell function to be called\&. The listed parameters are passed to the function\&.
.sp
The function is first searched for in
lib\&.base,
lib\&.common
and
lib\&.cli\&. If it is not found, the call command is passed to the generated script to be executed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclear \fR\fB \fR[\-\fBf\fR]
.RS 4
Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by shorewall6\-lite\&. The firewall is then wide open and unprotected\&. Existing connections are untouched\&. Clear is often used to see if the firewall is causing connection problems\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-f\fR
is given, the command will be processed by the compiled script that executed the last successful
\fBstart\fR,
\fBreload\fR,
\fBrestart\fR
or
\fBrefresh\fR
command if that script exists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclose\fR { \fIopen\-number\fR | \fIsource\fR \fIdest\fR [ \fIprotocol\fR [ \fIport\fR ] ] }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.8\&. This command closes a temporary open created by the
\fBopen\fR
command\&. In the first form, an
\fIopen\-number\fR
specifies the open to be closed\&. Open numbers are displayed in the
\fBnum\fR
column of the output of the
\fBshorewall6\-lite show opens \fRcommand\&.
.sp
When the second form of the command is used, the parameters must match those given in the earlier
\fBopen\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdelete \fR{ \fIinterface\fR[:\fIhost\-list\fR]\&.\&.\&. \fIzone\fR | \fIzone\fR \fIhost\-list\fR }
.RS 4
The delete command reverses the effect of an earlier
\fBadd\fR
command\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
argument names an interface defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5) file\&. A
\fIhost\-list\fR
is comma\-separated list whose elements are a host or network address\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdisable \fR{ \fIinterface\fR | \fIprovider\fR }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.26\&. Disables the optional provider associated with the specified
\fIinterface\fR
or
\fIprovider\fR\&. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a
\fIprovider\fR
name must be given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdrop \fR\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be silently dropped\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdump \fR[\-\fBx\fR] [\-\fBl\fR] [\-\fBm\fR] [\-\fBc\fR]
.RS 4
Produces a verbose report about the firewall configuration for the purpose of problem analysis\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-x\fR
option causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed\&. Without that option, these counts are abbreviated\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-m\fR
option causes any MAC addresses included in shorewall6\-lite log messages to be displayed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-l\fR
option causes the rule number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-c\fR
option causes the route cache to be dumped in addition to the other routing information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBenable \fR{ \fIinterface\fR | \fIprovider\fR }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.26\&. Enables the optional provider associated with the specified
\fIinterface\fR
or
\fIprovider\fR\&. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a
\fIprovider\fR
name must be given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBforget \fR[ \fIfilename\fR ]
.RS 4
Deletes
/var/lib/shorewall6\-lite/\fIfilename\fR
and
/var/lib/shorewall6\-lite/save\&. If no
\fIfilename\fR
is given then the file specified by RESTOREFILE in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhelp\fR
.RS 4
Displays a syntax summary\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhits\fR
.RS 4
Generates several reports from shorewall6\-lite log messages in the current log file\&. If the
\fB\-t\fR
option is included, the reports are restricted to log messages generated today\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBiptrace \fR\fIip6tables match expression\fR
.RS 4
This is a low\-level debugging command that causes iptables TRACE log records to be created\&. See iptables(8) for details\&.
.sp
The
\fIiptables match expression\fR
must be one or more matches that may appear in both the raw table OUTPUT and raw table PREROUTING chains\&.
.sp
The trace records are written to the kernel\*(Aqs log buffer with facility = kernel and priority = warning, and they are routed from there by your logging daemon (syslogd, rsyslog, syslog\-ng, \&.\&.\&.) \-\- shorewall6\-lite has no control over where the messages go; consult your logging daemon\*(Aqs documentation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlist\fR
.RS 4
\fBlist\fR
is a synonym for
\fBshow\fR
\-\- please see below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogdrop \fR\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be logged then discarded\&. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogwatch \fR[\-\fBm\fR] [\fIrefresh\-interval\fR]
.RS 4
Monitors the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) and produces an audible alarm when new shorewall6\-lite messages are logged\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-m\fR
option causes the MAC address of each packet source to be displayed if that information is available\&.
.sp
The
\fIrefresh\-interval\fR
specifies the time in seconds between screen refreshes\&. You can enter a negative number by preceding the number with "\-\-" (e\&.g\&.,
\fBshorewall6\-lite logwatch \-\- \-30\fR)\&. In this case, when a packet count changes, you will be prompted to hit any key to resume screen refreshes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogreject \fR\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be logged then rejected\&. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBls\fR
.RS 4
\fBls\fR
is a synonym for
\fBshow\fR
\-\- please see below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnoiptrace \fR\fIip6tables match expression\fR
.RS 4
This is a low\-level debugging command that cancels a trace started by a preceding
\fBiptrace\fR
command\&.
.sp
The
\fIip6tables match expression\fR
must be one given in the
\fBiptrace\fR
command being canceled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBopen\fR \fIsource\fR \fIdest\fR [ \fIprotocol\fR [ \fIport\fR ] ]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.8\&. This command requires that the firewall be in the started state and that DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf (5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&. The effect of the command is to temporarily open the firewall for connections matching the parameters\&.
.sp
The
\fIsource\fR
and
\fIdest\fR
parameters may each be specified as
\fBall\fR
if you don\*(Aqt wish to restrict the connection source or destination respectively\&. Otherwise, each must contain a host or network address or a valid DNS name\&.
.sp
The
\fIprotocol\fR
may be specified either as a number or as a name listed in /etc/protocols\&. The
\fIport\fR
may be specified numerically or as a name listed in /etc/services\&.
.sp
To reverse the effect of a successful
\fBopen\fR
command, use the
\fBclose\fR
command with the same parameters or simply restart the firewall\&.
.sp
Example: To open the firewall for SSH connections to address 2001:470:b:227::1, the command would be:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    shorewall6\-lite open all 2001:470:b:227::1 tcp 22
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To reverse that command, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    shorewall6\-lite close all 2001:470:b:227::1 tcp 22
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fBreenable\fR{ \fIinterface\fR | \fIprovider\fR }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.9\&. This is equivalent to a
\fBdisable\fR
command followed by an
\fBenable\fR
command on the specified
\fIinterface\fR
or
\fIprovider\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreject\fR\fI address\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be silently rejected\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreload \fR[\-n] [\-p] [\-\fBC\fR]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.0,
\fBreload\fR
is similar to
\fBshorewall6\-lite start\fR
except that it assumes that the firewall is already started\&. Existing connections are maintained\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-n\fR
option causes shorewall6\-lite to avoid updating the routing table(s)\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the
\fBconntrack\fR
utility must be installed to use this option\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-C\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.5\&. If the specified (or implicit) firewall script is the one that generated the current running configuration, then the running netfilter configuration will be reloaded as is so as to preserve the iptables packet and byte counters\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBreset [\fR\fB\fIchain\fR\fR\fB, \&.\&.\&.]\fR
.RS 4
Resets the packet and byte counters in the specified
\fIchain\fR(s)\&. If no
