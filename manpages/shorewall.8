.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The shorewall utility is used to control the Shoreline Firewall (Shorewall)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fBtrace\fR
and
\fBdebug\fR
options are used for debugging\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall\&.htm#Trace\fR\m[]\&.
.PP
The nolock
\fBoption\fR
prevents the command from attempting to acquire the Shorewall lockfile\&. It is useful if you need to include
\fBshorewall\fR
commands in
/etc/shorewall/started\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
control the amount of output that the command produces\&. They consist of a sequence of the letters
\fBv\fR
and
\fBq\fR\&. If the options are omitted, the amount of output is determined by the setting of the VERBOSITY parameter in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)\&. Each
\fBv\fR
adds one to the effective verbosity and each
\fBq\fR
subtracts one from the effective VERBOSITY\&. Anternately,
\fBv\fR
may be followed immediately with one of \-1,0,1,2 to specify a specify VERBOSITY\&. There may be no white space between
\fBv\fR
and the VERBOSITY\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
may also include the letter
\fBt\fR
which causes all progress messages to be timestamped\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
The available commands are listed below\&.
.PP
\fBadd\fR
.RS 4
Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN\*(Aqs\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
argument names an interface defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) file\&. A
\fIhost\-list\fR
is comma\-separated list whose elements are host or network addresses\&..if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBCaution\fR
.ps -1
.br
The
\fBadd\fR
command is not very robust\&. If there are errors in the
\fIhost\-list\fR, you may see a large number of error messages yet a subsequent
\fBshorewall show zones\fR
command will indicate that all hosts were added\&. If this happens, replace
\fBadd\fR
by
\fBdelete\fR
and run the same command again\&. Then enter the correct command\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBallow\fR
.RS 4
Re\-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously blacklisted by a
\fBdrop\fR,
\fBlogdrop\fR,
\fBreject\fR, or
\fBlogreject\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck\fR
.RS 4
Compiles the configuraton in the specified
\fIdirectory\fR
and discards the compiled output script\&. If no
\fIdirectory\fR
is given, then /etc/shorewall is assumed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-e\fR
option causes the compiler to look for a file named capabilities\&. This file is produced using the command
\fBshorewall\-lite show \-f capabilities > capabilities\fR
on a system with Shorewall Lite installed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-d\fR
option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl
\fB\-wd:DProf\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-r\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.2 and causes the compiler to print the generated ruleset to standard out\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-T\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler\-generated error and warning message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclear\fR
.RS 4
Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by Shorewall\&. The firewall is then wide open and unprotected\&. Existing connections are untouched\&. Clear is often used to see if the firewall is causing connection problems\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-f\fR
is given, the command will be processed by the compiled script that executed the last successful
\fBstart\fR,
\fBrestart\fR
or
\fBrefresh\fR
command if that script exists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcompile\fR
.RS 4
Compiles the current configuration into the executable file
\fIpathname\fR\&. If a directory is supplied, Shorewall will look in that directory first for configuration files\&. If the
\fIpathname\fR
is omitted, the file
firewall
in the VARDIR (normally
/var/lib/shorewall/) is assumed\&. A
\fIpathname\fR
of \*(Aq\-\*(Aq causes the compiler to send the generated script to it\*(Aqs standard output file\&. Note that \*(Aq\-v\-1\*(Aq is usually specified in this case (e\&.g\&.,
\fBshorewall \-v\-1 compile \-\- \-\fR) to suppress the \*(AqCompiling\&.\&.\&.\*(Aq message normally generated by
/sbin/shorewall\&.
.sp
When \-e is specified, the compilation is being performed on a system other than where the compiled script will run\&. This option disables certain configuration options that require the script to be compiled where it is to be run\&. The use of \-e requires the presense of a configuration file named
capabilities
which may be produced using the command
\fBshorewall\-lite show \-f capabilities > capabilities\fR
on a system with Shorewall Lite installed
.sp
The
\fB\-d\fR
option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl
\fB\-wd:DProf\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-T\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler\-generated error and warning message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdelete\fR
.RS 4
The delete command reverses the effect of an earlier
\fBadd\fR
command\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
argument names an interface defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) file\&. A
\fIhost\-list\fR
is comma\-separated list whose elements are a host or network address\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdisable\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.26\&. Disables the optional provider associated with the specified
\fIinterface\fR
or
\fIprovider\fR\&. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a
\fIprovider\fR
name must be given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdrop\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be silently dropped\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdump\fR
.RS 4
Produces a verbose report about the firewall configuration for the purpose of problem analysis\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-x\fR
option causes actual packet and byte counts to be displayed\&. Without that option, these counts are abbreviated\&. The
\fB\-m\fR
option causes any MAC addresses included in Shorewall log messages to be displayed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-l\fR
option causes the rule number for each Netfilter rule to be displayed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBenable\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.26\&. Enables the optional provider associated with the specified
\fIinterface\fR
or
\fIprovider\fR\&. Where more than one provider share a single network interface, a
\fIprovider\fR
name must be given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBexport\fR
.RS 4
If
\fIdirectory1\fR
is omitted, the current working directory is assumed\&.
.sp
Allows a non\-root user to compile a shorewall script and stage it on a system (provided that the user has access to the system via ssh)\&. The command is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    \fB/sbin/shorewall compile \-e\fR \fIdirectory1\fR \fIdirectory1\fR\fB/firewall &&\e\fR
    \fBscp\fR directory1\fB/firewall\fR \fIdirectory1\fR\fB/firewall\&.conf\fR [\fIuser\fR@]\fBsystem\fR:[\fIdirectory2\fR]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory\&. If compilation succeeds, then firewall and firewall\&.conf are copied to
\fIsystem\fR
using scp\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBforget\fR
.RS 4
Deletes /var/lib/shorewall/\fIfilenam\fRe and /var/lib/shorewall/save\&. If no
\fIfilename\fR
is given then the file specified by RESTOREFILE in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5) is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhelp\fR
.RS 4
Displays a syntax summary\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhits\fR
.RS 4
Generates several reports from Shorewall log messages in the current log file\&. If the
\fB\-t\fR
option is included, the reports are restricted to log messages generated today\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBipcalc\fR
.RS 4
Ipcalc displays the network address, broadcast address, network in CIDR notation and netmask corresponding to the input[s]\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBiprange\fR
.RS 4
Iprange decomposes the specified range of IP addresses into the equivalent list of network/host addresses\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBiptrace\fR
.RS 4
This is a low\-level debugging command that causes iptables TRACE log records to be created\&. See iptables(8) for details\&.
.sp
The
\fIiptables match expression\fR
must be one or more matches that may appear in both the raw table OUTPUT and raw table PREROUTING chains\&.
.sp
The trace records are written to the kernel\*(Aqs log buffer with faciility = kernel and priority = warning, and they are routed from there by your logging daemon (syslogd, rsyslog, syslog\-ng, \&.\&.\&.) \-\- Shorewall has no control over where the messages go; consult your logging daemon\*(Aqs documentation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBload\fR
.RS 4
If
\fIdirectory\fR
is omitted, the current working directory is assumed\&. Allows a non\-root user to compile a shorewall script and install it on a system (provided that the user has root access to the system via ssh)\&. The command is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    \fB/sbin/shorewall compile \-e\fR \fI\fIdirectory\fR\fR \fIdirectory\fR\fB/firewall &&\e\fR

    \fBssh root@\fR\fIsystem\fR \fB\*(Aq/sbin/shorewall\-lite start\*(Aq\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory\&. If compilation succeeds, then firewall is copied to
\fIsystem\fR
using scp\&. If the copy succeeds, Shorewall Lite on
\fIsystem\fR
is started via ssh\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-s\fR
is specified and the
\fBstart\fR
command succeeds, then the remote Shorewall\-lite configuration is saved by executing
\fBshorewall\-lite save\fR
via ssh\&.
.sp
if
\fB\-c\fR
is included, the command
\fBshorewall\-lite show capabilities \-f > /var/lib/shorewall\-lite/capabilities\fR
is executed via ssh then the generated file is copied to
\fIdirectory\fR
using scp\&. This step is performed before the configuration is compiled\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-r\fR
is included, it specifies that the root user on
\fIsystem\fR
is named
\fIroot\-user\-name\fR
rather than "root"\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-T\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.3 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler\-generated error and warning message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogdrop\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be logged then discarded\&. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogwatch\fR
.RS 4
Monitors the log file specified by the LOGFILE option in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5) and produces an audible alarm when new Shorewall messages are logged\&. The
\fB\-m\fR
option causes the MAC address of each packet source to be displayed if that information is available\&. The
\fIrefresh\-interval\fR
specifies the time in seconds between screen refreshes\&. You can enter a negative number by preceding the number with "\-\-" (e\&.g\&.,
\fBshorewall logwatch \-\- \-30\fR)\&. In this case, when a packet count changes, you will be prompted to hit any key to resume screen refreshes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogreject\fR
.RS 4
Causes traffic from the listed
\fIaddress\fRes to be logged then rejected\&. Logging occurs at the log level specified by the BLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL setting in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnoiptrace\fR
.RS 4
This is a low\-level debugging command that cancels a trace started by a preceding
\fBiptrace\fR
command\&.
.sp
The
\fIiptables match expression\fR
must be one given in the
\fBiptrace\fR
command being cancelled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrefresh\fR
.RS 4
All steps performed by
\fBrestart\fR
are performed by
\fBrefresh\fR
with the exception that
\fBrefresh\fR
only recreates the chains specified in the command while
\fBrestart\fR
recreates the entire Netfilter ruleset\&. If no
\fIchain\fR
is given, the static blacklisting chain
\fBblacklst\fR
is assumed\&.
.sp
The listed chains are assumed to be in the filter table\&. You can refresh chains in other tables by prefixing the chain name with the table name followed by ":" (e\&.g\&., nat:net_dnat)\&. Chain names which follow are assumed to be in that table until the end of the list or until an entry in the list names another table\&. Built\-in chains such as FORWARD may not be refreshed\&.

The \-\fBD\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.3 and causes Shorewall to look in the given
\fIdirectory\fR
first for configuration files\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBshorewall refresh net2fw nat:net_dnat\fR #Refresh the \*(Aqnet2loc\*(Aq chain in the filter table and the \*(Aqnet_dnat\*(Aq chain in the nat table
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The
\fBrefresh\fR
command has slightly different behavior\&. When no chain name is given to the
\fBrefresh\fR
command, the mangle table is refreshed along with the blacklist chain (if any)\&. This allows you to modify
/etc/shorewall/tcrulesand install the changes using
\fBrefresh\fR\&.
.RE

\fBreload\fR
.RS 4
If
\fIdirectory\fR
is omitted, the current working directory is assumed\&. Allows a non\-root user to compile a shorewall script and install it on a system (provided that the user has root access to the system via ssh)\&. The command is equivalent to:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
    \fB/sbin/shorewall compile \-e\fR \fIdirectory\fR \fIdirectory\fR\fB/firewall &&\e\fR

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In other words, the configuration in the specified (or defaulted) directory is compiled to a file called firewall in that directory\&. If compilation succeeds, then firewall is copied to
\fIsystem\fR
using scp\&. If the copy succeeds, Shorewall Lite on
\fIsystem\fR
is restarted via ssh\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-s\fR
is specified and the
\fBrestart\fR
command succeeds, then the remote Shorewall\-lite configuration is saved by executing
\fBshorewall\-lite save\fR
via ssh\&.
.sp
if
\fB\-c\fR
is included, the command
\fBshorewall\-lite show capabilities \-f > /var/lib/shorewall\-lite/capabilities\fR
is executed via ssh then the generated file is copied to
\fIdirectory\fR
using scp\&. This step is performed before the configuration is compiled\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-r\fR
is included, it specifies that the root user on
\fIsystem\fR
is named
\fIroot\-user\-name\fR
rather than "root"\&.

Restart is similar to

except that it assumes that the firewall is already started\&. Existing connections are maintained\&. If a
\fIdirectory\fR

\fIdirectory\fR

.sp
The
\fB\-n\fR

.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the connection tracking table to be flushed; the
\fBconntrack\fR
utility must be installed to use this option\&.
.sp
The

.sp
The
\fB\-f\fR
option suppresses the compilation step and simply reused the compiled script which last started/restarted Shorewall, provided that /etc/shorewall and its contents have not been modified since the last start/restart\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-c\fR
