.SH "NAME"
hosts \- shorewall6 file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 22
\fB/etc/shorewall6/hosts\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define zones in terms of subnets and/or individual IP addresses\&. Most simple setups don\'t need to (should not) place anything in this file\&.
.PP
The order of entries in this file is not significant in determining zone composition\&. Rather, the order that the zones are declared in
\fIshorewall6\-zones\fR\&[1](5) determines the order in which the records in this file are interpreted\&.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
Warning
.PP
The only time that you need this file is when you have more than one zone connected through a single interface\&.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
Warning
.PP
If you have an entry for a zone and interface in
\fIshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\&[2](5) then do not include any entries in this file for that same (zone, interface) pair\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBZONE\fR \- \fIzone\-name\fR
.RS 4
The name of a zone declared in
\fIshorewall6\-zones\fR\&[1](5)\&. You may not list the firewall zone in this column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHOST(S)\fR \- \fIinterface\fR:\fB[\fR{[{\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR]\&.\&.\&.|\fB+\fR\fIipset\fR}[\fIexclusion\fR]\fB]\fR
.RS 4
The name of an interface defined in the
\fIshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\&[2](5) file followed by a colon (":") and a comma\-separated list whose elements are either:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'The IPv6
\fIaddress\fR
of a host\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'A network in CIDR format\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 3.\h'+02'An IP address range of the form
\fIlow\&.address\fR\-\fIhigh\&.address\fR\&. Your kernel and ip6tables must have iprange match support\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 4.\h'+02'The name of an
\fIipset\fR\&.
.RE
.IP "" 4
You may also exclude certain hosts through use of an
\fIexclusion\fR
(see
\fIshorewall6\-exclusion\fR\&[3](5)\&.
.RE
.PP
OPTIONS (Optional) \- [\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fIoption\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of options from the following list\&. The order in which you list the options is not significant but the list must have no embedded white space\&.
.PP
\fBrouteback\fR
.RS 4
shorewall6 should set up the infrastructure to pass packets from this/these address(es) back to themselves\&. This is necessary if hosts in this group use the services of a transparent proxy that is a member of the group or if DNAT is used to send requests originating from this group to a server in the group\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBblacklist\fR
.RS 4
This option only makes sense for ports on a bridge\&.
.sp
Check packets arriving on this port against the
\fIshorewall6\-blacklist\fR\&[4](5) file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtcpflags\fR
.RS 4
Packets arriving from these hosts are checked for certain illegal combinations of TCP flags\&. Packets found to have such a combination of flags are handled according to the setting of TCP_FLAGS_DISPOSITION after having been logged according to the setting of TCP_FLAGS_LOG_LEVEL\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBipsec\fR
.RS 4
The zone is accessed via a kernel 2\&.6 ipsec SA\&. Note that if the zone named in the ZONE column is specified as an IPSEC zone in the
\fIshorewall6\-zones\fR\&[1](5) file then you do NOT need to specify the \'ipsec\' option here\&.
