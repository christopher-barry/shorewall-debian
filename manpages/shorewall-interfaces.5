\fB/etc/shorewall/interfaces\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The interfaces file serves to define the firewall\*(Aqs network interfaces to Shorewall\&. The order of entries in this file is not significant in determining zone composition\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBZONE\fR \- \fIzone\-name\fR
.RS 4
Zone for this interface\&. Must match the name of a zone declared in /etc/shorewall/zones\&. You may not list the firewall zone in this column\&.
.sp
If the interface serves multiple zones that will be defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-hosts\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5) file, you should place "\-" in this column\&.
.sp
If there are multiple interfaces to the same zone, you must list them in separate entries\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#ZONE   INTERFACE       BROADCAST
loc     eth1            \-
loc     eth2            \-
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR\fB[:\fR\fIport\fR\fB]\fR
.RS 4
Logical name of interface\&. Each interface may be listed only once in this file\&. You may NOT specify the name of a "virtual" interface (e\&.g\&., eth0:0) here; see
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/FAQ\&.htm#faq18\fR\m[]\&. If the
\fBphysical\fR
option is not specified, then the logical name is also the name of the actual interface\&.
.sp
You may use wildcards here by specifying a prefix followed by the plus sign ("+")\&. For example, if you want to make an entry that applies to all PPP interfaces, use \*(Aqppp+\*(Aq; that would match ppp0, ppp1, ppp2, \&... Please note that the \*(Aq+\*(Aq means \*(Aq\fBone\fR
or more additional characters\*(Aq so \*(Aqppp\*(Aq does not match \*(Aqppp+\*(Aq\&.
.sp
When using Shorewall versions before 4\&.1\&.4, care must be exercised when using wildcards where there is another zone that uses a matching specific interface\&. See
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-nesting\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5) for a discussion of this problem\&.
.sp
Shorewall allows \*(Aq+\*(Aq as an interface name\&.
.sp
There is no need to define the loopback interface (lo) in this file\&.
.sp
If a
\fIport\fR
is given, then the
\fIinterface\fR
must have been defined previously with the
\fBbridge\fR
option\&. The OPTIONS column may not contain the following options when a
\fIport\fR
is given\&.

\fBBROADCAST\fR (Optional) \- {\fB\-\fR|\fBdetect\fR|\fIaddress\fR[,\fIaddress\fR]\&.\&.\&.}
.RS 4
If you use the special value
\fBdetect\fR, Shorewall will detect the broadcast address(es) for you if your iptables and kernel include Address Type Match support\&.
.sp
If your iptables and/or kernel lack Address Type Match support then you may list the broadcast address(es) for the network(s) to which the interface belongs\&. For P\-T\-P interfaces, this column is left blank\&. If the interface has multiple addresses on multiple subnets then list the broadcast addresses as a comma\-separated list\&.
.sp
If you don\*(Aqt want to give a value for this column but you want to enter a value in the OPTIONS column, enter
\fB\-\fR
in this column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOPTIONS\fR (Optional) \- [\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fIoption\fR]\&.\&.\&.]

A comma\-separated list of options from the following list\&. The order in which you list the options is not significant but the list should have no embedded white space\&.
.PP
\fBarp_filter[={0|1}]\fR
.RS 4
If specified, this interface will only respond to ARP who\-has requests for IP addresses configured on the interface\&. If not specified, the interface can respond to ARP who\-has requests for IP addresses on any of the firewall\*(Aqs interface\&. The interface must be up when Shorewall is started\&.

\fBlogmartians[={0|1}]\fR
.RS 4
Turn on kernel martian logging (logging of packets with impossible source addresses\&. It is strongly suggested that if you set
\fBroutefilter\fR
on an interface that you also set
\fBlogmartians\fR\&. Even if you do not specify the
\fBroutefilter\fR
option, it is a good idea to specify
\fBlogmartians\fR
because your distribution may have enabled route filtering without you knowing it\&.

Only those interfaces with the

To find out if route filtering is set on a given

\fBmss\fR=\fInumber\fR

.RE

\fBnets=(\fR\fB\fInet\fR\fR\fB[,\&.\&.\&.])\fR

\fBrouteback\fR
.RS 4
If specified, indicates that Shorewall should include rules that allow traffic arriving on this interface to be routed back out that same interface\&. This option is also required when you have used a wildcard in the INTERFACE column if you want to allow traffic between the interfaces that match the wildcard\&.
