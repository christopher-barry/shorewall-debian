.SH "NAME"
blacklist \- shorewall6 Blacklist file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 26
\fB/etc/shorewall6/blacklist\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The blacklist file is used to perform static blacklisting\&. You can blacklist by source address (IP or MAC), or by application\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBADDRESS/SUBNET\fR \- {\fB\-\fR|\fB~\fR\fImac\-address\fR|\fIip\-address\fR|\fIaddress\-range\fR|\fB+\fR\fIipset\fR}
.RS 4
Host address, network address, MAC address, IP address range (if your kernel and ip6tables contain iprange match support) or ipset name prefaced by "+" (if your kernel supports ipset match)\&.
.sp
MAC addresses must be prefixed with "~" and use "\-" as a separator\&.
.sp
Example: ~00\-A0\-C9\-15\-39\-78
.sp
A dash ("\-") in this column means that any source address will match\&. This is useful if you want to blacklist a particular application using entries in the PROTOCOL and PORTS columns\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPROTOCOL\fR (Optional) \- {\fB\-\fR|\fIprotocol\-number\fR|\fIprotocol\-name\fR}
.RS 4
If specified, must be a protocol number or a protocol name from protocols(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPORTS\fR (Optional) \- {\fB\-\fR|\fIport\-name\-or\-number\fR[,\fIport\-name\-or\-number\fR]\&.\&.\&.}
.RS 4
May only be specified if the protocol is TCP (6), UDP (17), DCCP (33), SCTP (132) or UDPLITE (136)\&. A comma\-separated list of destination port numbers or service names from services(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
When a packet arrives on an interface that has the
\fBblacklist\fR
option specified in
\fIshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\&[1](5), its source IP address and MAC address is checked against this file and disposed of according to the
\fBBLACKLIST_DISPOSITION\fR
and
\fBBLACKLIST_LOGLEVEL\fR
variables in
\fIshorewall6\&.conf\fR\&[2](5)\&. If
\fBPROTOCOL\fR
or
\fBPROTOCOL\fR
and
\fBPORTS\fR
are supplied, only packets matching the protocol (and one of the ports if
\fBPORTS\fR
supplied) are blocked\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"

Example 1:
.RS 4
To block DNS queries from address fe80::2a0:ccff:fedb:31c4:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
        #ADDRESS/SUBNET            PROTOCOL        PORT
        fe80::2a0:ccff:fedb:31c4/  udp             53
.fi

.PP
Example 2:
.RS 4
To block some of the nuisance applications:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
        #ADDRESS/SUBNET         PROTOCOL        PORT
        \-                       udp             1024:1033,1434
        \-                       tcp             57,1433,1434,2401,2745,3127,3306,3410,4899,5554,6101,8081,9898
