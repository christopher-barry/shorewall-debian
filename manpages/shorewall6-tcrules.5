Unlike rules in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-rules\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5) file, evaluation of rules in this file will continue after a match\&. So the final mark for each packet will be the one assigned by the LAST tcrule that matches\&.
.PP
If you use multiple internet providers with the \*(Aqtrack\*(Aq option, in /etc/shorewall6/providers be sure to read the restrictions at
\m[blue]\fBhttp://shorewall\&.net/MultiISP\&.html\fR\m[]\&.

.RE
.PP
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.5\&.4, the tcrules file supports two different formats:
.PP
FORMAT 1 (default \- deprecated)
.RS 4
The older limited\-function version of TPROXY is supported\&.
.RE
.PP
FORMAT 2
.RS 4
The newer version of TPROXY is supported\&.
.RE
.PP
The format is specified by a line as follows:
.PP
\fB[?]FORMAT {1|2}\fR
.PP
The optional \*(Aq?\*(Aq was introduced in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.11 and ?FORMAT is the preferred form; the form without the \*(Aq?\*(Aq is deprecated\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate specification syntax)\&.
.PP
\fBACTION\fR \- \fIaction\fR
.RS 4
\fIaction\fR
may assume one of the following values\&.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

A mark
\fIvalue\fR
which is an integer in the range 1\-255\&.
.sp
Normally will set the mark value\&. If preceded by a vertical bar ("|"), the mark value will be logically ORed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&. If preceded by an ampersand ("&"), will be logically ANDed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&.
.sp
Both "|" and "&" require Extended MARK Target support in your kernel and ip6tables; neither may be used with connection marks (see below)\&.
.sp
May optionally be followed by
\fB:P\fR,
\fB:F\fR
or
\fB:T\fR,
\fB:I \fRwhere\fB :P\fR
indicates that marking should occur in the PREROUTING chain,
\fB:F\fR
indicates that marking should occur in the FORWARD chain,
\fB:I \fRindicates that marking should occur in the INPUT chain (added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13) and
\fB:T\fR
indicates that marking should occur in the POSTROUTING chain\&. If neither
\fB:P\fR,
\fB:F\fR
nor
\fB:T\fR
follow the mark value then the chain is determined as follows:
.sp
\- If the SOURCE is
\fB$FW\fR[\fB:\fR\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR[,\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR]\&.\&.\&.], then the rule is inserted into the OUTPUT chain\&. The behavior changed in Shorewall6\-perl 4\&.1\&. Only high mark values may be assigned in this case\&. Packet marking rules for traffic shaping of packets originating on the firewall must be coded in the POSTROUTING chain (see below)\&.
.sp
\- Otherwise, the chain is determined by the setting of MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Please note that
\fB:I\fR
is included for completeness and affects neither traffic shaping nor policy routing\&.
.sp
If your kernel and ip6tables include CONNMARK support then you can also mark the connection rather than the packet\&.
.sp
The mark value may be optionally followed by "/" and a mask value (used to determine those bits of the connection mark to actually be set)\&. When a mask is specified, the result of logically ANDing the mark value with the mask must be the same as the mark value\&.
.sp
The mark and optional mask are then followed by one of:+

A mark range which is a pair of integers separated by a dash ("\-")\&. Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.9\&.
.sp
May be optionally followed by a slash ("/") and a mask and requires the
Statistics Match
capability in iptables and kernel\&. Marks in the specified range are assigned to packets on a round\-robin fashion\&.
.sp
When a mask is specified, the result of logically ANDing each mark value with the mask must be the same as the mark value\&. The least significant bit in the mask is used as an increment\&. For example, if \*(Aq0x200\-0x400/0xff00\*(Aq is specified, then the assigned mark values are 0x200, 0x300 and 0x400 in equal proportions\&. If no mask is specified, then ( 2 ** MASK_BITS ) \- 1 is assumed (MASK_BITS is set in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5))\&.
.sp
May optionally be followed by

indicates that marking should occur in the FORWARD chain,
\fB:I \fRindicates that marking should occur in the INPUT chain (added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13), and
\fB:T\fR
indicates that marking should occur in the POSTROUTING chain\&. If neither
\fB:P\fR,
\fB:F\fR
nor
\fB:T\fR
follow the mark value then the chain is determined as follows:
.sp
\- If the SOURCE is
\fB$FW\fR[\fB:\fR\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR[,\fIaddress\-or\-range\fR]\&.\&.\&.], then the rule is inserted into the OUTPUT chain\&. When HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes, only high mark values may be assigned there\&. Packet marking rules for traffic shaping of packets originating on the firewall must be coded in the POSTROUTING chain (see below)\&.
.sp
\- Otherwise, the chain is determined by the setting of MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5)\&.

Classification occurs in the POSTROUTING chain except when the
\fBSOURCE\fR
is
\fB$FW\fR[:\fIaddress\fR] in which case classification occurs in the OUTPUT chain\&.
.sp
When using Shorewall6\*(Aqs built\-in traffic shaping tool, the
\fImajor\fR
class is the device number (the first device in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5) is major class 1, the second device is major class 2, and so on) and the
\fIminor\fR
class is the class\*(Aqs MARK value in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcclasses\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2(5) preceded by the number 1 (MARK 1 corresponds to minor class 11, MARK 5 corresponds to minor class 15, MARK 22 corresponds to minor class 122, etc\&.)\&.

\fBSAME\fR
(Added in Shorewall 4\&.3\&.5) \-\- Some websites run applications that require multiple connections from a client browser\&. Where multiple \*(Aqbalanced\*(Aq providers are configured, this can lead to problems when some of the connections are routed through one provider and some through another\&. The SAME target allows you to work around that problem\&. SAME may be used in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains\&. When used in PREROUTING, it causes matching connections from an individual local system to all use the same provider\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#ACTION           SOURCE         DEST         PROTO      DEST
#                                                        PORT(S)
SAME:P            192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24 0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0    tcp        80,443
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If a host in 192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24 attempts a connection on TCP port 80 or 443 and it has sent a packet on either of those ports in the last five minutes then the new connection will use the same provider as the connection over which that last packet was sent\&.
.sp
When used in the OUTPUT chain, it causes all matching connections to an individual remote system to all use the same provider\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#ACTION           SOURCE         DEST         PROTO      DEST

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the firewall attempts a connection on TCP port 80 or 443 and it has sent a packet on either of those ports in the last five minutes to the same remote system then the new connection will use the same provider as the connection over which that last packet was sent\&.

.sp
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.1\&. Sets the

field in the IP header\&. The
\fItos\fR
value may be given as an number (hex or decimal) or as the name of a TOS type\&. Valid type names and their associated hex numeric values are:
.sp

0x3f is assumed\&.

.RS 4
Source of the packet\&. A comma\-separated list of interface names, IP addresses, MAC addresses and/or subnets for packets being routed through a common path\&. List elements may also consist of an interface name followed by ":" and an address (e\&.g\&., eth1:<2002:ce7c:92b4::/48>)\&. For example, all packets for connections masqueraded to eth0 from other interfaces can be matched in a single rule with several alternative SOURCE criteria\&. However, a connection whose packets gets to eth0 in a different way, e\&.g\&., direct from the firewall itself, needs a different rule\&.
.sp
Accordingly, use $\fBFW\fR
in its own separate rule for packets originating on the firewall\&. In such a rule, the ACTION column may NOT specify either
\fB:P\fR

\fB:F\fR
