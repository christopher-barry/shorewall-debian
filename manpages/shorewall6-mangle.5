.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file was introduced in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.0 and is intended to replace
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcrules(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&. This file is only processed by the compiler if:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
No file named \*(Aqtcrules\*(Aq exists on the current CONFIG_PATH (see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2); or

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
The first file named \*(Aqtcrules\*(Aq found on the CONFIG_PATH contains no non\-commentary entries\&.
.RE
.PP
Entries in this file cause packets to be marked as a means of classifying them for traffic control or policy routing\&.

Unlike rules in the

.PP
If you use multiple internet providers with the \*(Aqtrack\*(Aq option, in /etc/shorewall/providers be sure to read the restrictions at

The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate specification syntax)\&.
.PP
\fBACTION\fR \- \fIcommand\fR[(\fIparameters\fR)][:\fIchain\-designator\fR]
.RS 4
The
\fIchain\-designator\fR
indicates the Netfilter chain that the entry applies to and may be one of the following:
.PP
P
.RS 4
PREROUTING chain\&.
.RE
.PP

FORWARD chain\&.
.RE
.PP
T
.RS 4
POSTROUTING chain\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
INPUT chain\&.
.RE
.sp
Unless otherwise specified for the particular
\fIcommand\fR, the default chain is PREROUTING when MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=No in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2, and FORWARD when MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=Yes\&.
.sp
A
\fIchain\-designator\fR
may not be specified if the SOURCE or DEST columns begin with \*(Aq$FW\*(Aq\&. When the SOURCE is $FW, the generated rule is always placed in the OUTPUT chain\&. If DEST is \*(Aq$FW\*(Aq, then the rule is placed in the INPUT chain\&. Additionally, a
\fIchain\-designator\fR
may not be specified in an action body unless the action is declared as
\fBinline\fR
in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Where a command takes parameters, those parameters are enclosed in parentheses ("(\&.\&.\&.\&.)") and separated by commas\&.
.sp
The
\fIcommand\fR
may be one of the following\&.
.PP
\fB\fIaction\fR\fR\fB[([\fR\fB\fIparam\fR\fR\fB[,\&.\&.\&.])]\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.7\&.
\fIaction\fR
must be an action declared with the
\fBmangle\fR
option in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-actions(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2\&. If the action accepts paramaters, they are specified as a comma\-separated list within parentheses following the
\fIaction\fR
name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBADD(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.7\&. Causes addresses and/or port numbers to be added to the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be added to the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be added using
\fIflags\fR\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-A command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
ADD is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCHECKSUM\fR
.RS 4
Compute and fill in the checksum in a packet that lacks a checksum\&. This is particularly useful if you need to work around old applications, such as dhcp clients, that do not work well with checksum offloads, but you don\*(Aqt want to disable checksum offload in your device\&.
.sp
Requires \*(AqChecksum Target\*(Aq support in your kernel and iptables\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCLASSIFY(\fR\fB\fIclassid\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
A classification Id (classid) is of the form
\fImajor\fR:\fIminor\fR
where
\fImajor\fR
and
\fIminor\fR
are integers\&. Corresponds to the \*(Aqclass\*(Aq specification in these traffic shaping modules:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
       atm
       cbq
       dsmark
       pfifo_fast
       htb
       prio
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Classification occurs in the POSTROUTING chain except when the
\fBSOURCE\fR
is
\fB$FW\fR[:\fIaddress\fR] in which case classification occurs in the OUTPUT chain\&.
.sp
When using Shorewall\*(Aqs built\-in traffic shaping tool, the
\fImajor\fR
class is the device number (the first device in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcdevices\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[7]\d\s+2(5) is major class 1, the second device is major class 2, and so on) and the
\fIminor\fR
class is the class\*(Aqs MARK value in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcclasses\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[8]\d\s+2(5) preceded by the number 1 (MARK 1 corresponds to minor class 11, MARK 5 corresponds to minor class 15, MARK 22 corresponds to minor class 122, etc\&.)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB?COMMENT\fR
.RS 4
The rest of the line will be attached as a comment to the Netfilter rule(s) generated by the following entries\&. The comment will appear delimited by "/* \&.\&.\&. */" in the output of
\fBshorewall show mangle\fR
.sp
To stop the comment from being attached to further rules, simply include ?COMMENT on a line by itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONMARK({mark|range})\fR
.RS 4
Identical to MARK with the exception that the mark is assigned to connection to which the packet belongs is marked rather than to the packet itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE\fR
.RS 4
Don\*(Aqt process any more marking rules in the table\&.
.sp
Currently, CONTINUE may not be used with
\fIexclusion\fR
(see the SOURCE and DEST columns below); that restriction will be removed when iptables/Netfilter provides the necessary support\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDEL(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.7\&. Causes an entry to be deleted from the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be deleted from the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be deleted using
\fIflags\fR\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-D command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
DEL is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDIVERT\fR
.RS 4
Two DIVERT rule should precede the TPROXY rule and should select DEST PORT tcp 80 and SOURCE PORT tcp 80 respectively (assuming that tcp port 80 is being proxied)\&. DIVERT avoids sending packets to the TPROXY target once a socket connection to Squid3 has been established by TPROXY\&. DIVERT marks the packet with a unique mark and exempts it from any rules that follow\&.

\fBHL\fR([\fB\-\fR|\fB+\fR]\fInumber\fR)[:P]
.RS 4
If
\fB+\fR

\fBINLINE\fR[(\fIaction\fR)]
.RS 4
Allows you to place your own ip[6]tables matches at the end of the line following a semicolon (";")\&. If an

\fIaction\fR
had been specified in this column\&. If no action is specified, then you may include your own jump ("\-j
\fItarget\fR
[\fIoption\fR] \&.\&.\&.") after any matches specified at the end of the rule\&. If the target is not one known to Shorewall, then it must be defined as a builtin action in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[10]\d\s+2

.sp
The following rules are equivalent:
.sp

.sp
If INLINE_MATCHES=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[11]\d\s+2

.RE
.PP
\fBIPMARK\fR
.RS 4
Assigns a mark to each matching packet based on the either the source or destination IP address\&. By default, it assigns a mark value equal to the low\-order 8 bits of the source address\&. Default values are:
.RS 4
src
.RE
.RS 4
\fImask1\fR = 0xFF
.RE
.RS 4
\fImask2\fR = 0x00
.RE
.RS 4
\fIshift\fR = 0
.RE
\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq and \*(Aqdst\*(Aq specify whether the mark is to be based on the source or destination address respectively\&. The selected address is first shifted to the right by
\fIshift\fR
bits\&. The result is then LANDed with
\fImask1\fR
then LORed with
\fIma\fR\fI\fIs\fR\fR\fIk2\fR\&.
.sp
In a sense, the IPMARK target is more like an IPCLASSIFY target in that the mark value is later interpreted as a class ID\&. A packet mark is 32 bits wide; so is a class ID\&. The <major> class occupies the high\-order 16 bits and the <minor> class occupies the low\-order 16 bits\&. So the class ID 1:4ff (remember that class IDs are always in hex) is equivalent to a mark value of 0x104ff\&. Remember that Shorewall uses the interface number as the <major> number where the first interface in tcdevices has <major> number 1, the second has <major> number 2, and so on\&.
.sp
The IPMARK target assigns a mark to each matching packet based on the either the source or destination IP address\&. By default, it assigns a mark value equal to the low\-order 8 bits of the source address\&. The syntax is as follows:
\fBIPMARK\fR[([{\fBsrc\fR|\fBdst\fR}][,[\fImask1\fR][,[\fImask2\fR][,[\fIshift\fR]]]])]
Default values are:
.RS 4
\fBsrc\fR

.RS 4
\fImask2\fR = 0x00
.RE
.RS 4
\fIshift\fR = 0
.RE
\fBsrc\fR
and
\fBdst\fR
specify whether the mark is to be based on the source or destination address respectively\&. The selected address is first shifted right by
\fIshift\fR, then LANDed with
\fImask1\fR
and then LORed with
\fImask2\fR\&. The
\fIshift\fR
argument is intended to be used primarily with IPv6 addresses\&.
.sp
Example:
IPMARK(src,0xff,0x10100)
.RS 4
Suppose that the source IP address is 192\&.168\&.4\&.3

0x03 LOR 0x10100 = 0x10103 or class ID
                    1:103
.RE
It is important to realize that, while class IDs are composed of a
\fImajor\fR
and a
\fIminor\fR
value, the set of values must be unique\&. That is, the same numeric value cannot be used as both a
\fImajor\fR
and a
\fIminor\fR
number for the same interface unless class nesting occurs (which is not currently possible with Shorewall)\&. You should keep this in mind when deciding how to map IP addresses to class IDs\&.
.sp
For example, suppose that your internal network is 192\&.168\&.1\&.0/29 (host IP addresses 192\&.168\&.1\&.1 \- 192\&.168\&.1\&.6)\&. Your first notion might be to use IPMARK(src,0xFF,0x10000) so as to produce class IDs 1:1 through 1:6\&. But 1:1 is an invalid class ID since the
\fImajor\fR
and
\fIminor\fR
classes are equal\&. So you might choose instead to use IPMARK(src,0xFF,0x10100) as in the example above so that all of your
\fIminor\fR
classes will have a value > 256\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBIP6TABLES({\fR\fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIoption\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&.])\fR
.RS 4
This action allows you to specify an iptables target with options (e\&.g\&., \*(AqIP6TABLES(MARK \-\-set\-xmark 0x01/0xff)\*(Aq\&. If the target is not one recognized by Shorewall, the following error message will be issued:
.RS 4
ERROR: Unknown target
                  (\fItarget\fR)
.RE
This error message may be eliminated by adding the

\fBMARK({\fR\fB\fImark\fR\fR\fB|\fR\fB\fIrange\fR\fR\fB})\fR
.RS 4
where
\fImark\fR
is a packet mark value\&.
.sp
Normally will set the mark value\&. If preceded by a vertical bar ("|"), the mark value will be logically ORed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&. If preceded by an ampersand ("&"), will be logically ANDed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&.
.sp
Both "|" and "&" require Extended MARK Target support in your kernel and iptables\&.
.sp
The mark value may be optionally followed by "/" and a mask value (used to determine those bits of the connection mark to actually be set)\&. When a mask is specified, the result of logically ANDing the mark value with the mask must be the same as the mark value\&.
.sp
A mark
\fIrange\fR
is a pair of integers separated by a dash ("\-")\&.
.sp
May be optionally followed by a slash ("/") and a mask and requires the
Statistics Match
capability in iptables and kernel\&. Marks in the specified range are assigned to packets on a round\-robin fashion\&.
.sp
When a mask is specified, the result of logically ANDing each mark value with the mask must be the same as the mark value\&. The least significant bit in the mask is used as an increment\&. For example, if \*(Aq0x200\-0x400/0xff00\*(Aq is specified, then the assigned mark values are 0x200, 0x300 and 0x400 in equal proportions\&. If no mask is specified, then ( 2 ** MASK_BITS ) \- 1 is assumed (MASK_BITS is set in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5))\&.

.PP
\fBSAME[(\fR\fB\fItimeout\fR\fR\fB)]\fR
.RS 4
Some websites run applications that require multiple connections from a client browser\&. Where multiple \*(Aqbalanced\*(Aq providers are configured, this can lead to problems when some of the connections are routed through one provider and some through another\&. The SAME target allows you to work around that problem\&. SAME may be used in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains\&. When used in PREROUTING, it causes matching connections from an individual local system to all use the same provider\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#ACTION           SOURCE         DEST         PROTO      DPORT
SAME:P            192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24 0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0    tcp        80,443
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If a host in 192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24 attempts a connection on TCP port 80 or 443 and it has sent a packet on either of those ports in the last five minutes then the new connection will use the same provider as the connection over which that last packet was sent\&.
.sp
When used in the OUTPUT chain, it causes all matching connections to an individual remote system to all use the same provider\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
