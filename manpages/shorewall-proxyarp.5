.SH "NAME"
proxyarp \- Shorewall Proxy ARP file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 24
\fB/etc/shorewall/proxyarp\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define Proxy ARP\&. There is one entry in this file for each IP address to be proxied\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBADDRESS\fR \- \fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
IP Address\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR
.RS 4
Local interface where system with the ip address in ADDRESS is connected\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBEXTERNAL\fR \- \fIinterface\fR
.RS 4
External Interface to be used to access this system from the Internet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHAVEROUTE\fR \- [\fB\-\fR|\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR]
.RS 4
If there is already a route from the firewall to the host whose address is given, enter
\fBYes\fR
or
\fByes\fR
in this column\&. Otherwise, enter
\fBno\fR
or
\fBNo\fR
or leave the column empty and Shorewall will add the route for you\&. If Shorewall adds the route, its persistence depends on the value of the\fBPERSISTENT\fR
column contains
\fBYes\fR; otherwise,
\fBshorewall stop\fR
or
\fBshorewall clear\fR
will delete the route\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPERSISTENT\fR \- [\fB\-\fR|\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR]
.RS 4
If HAVEROUTE is
\fBNo\fR
or
\fBno\fR, then the value of this column determines if the route added by Shorewall persists after a
\fBshorewall stop\fR
or a
\fBshorewall clear\fR\&. If this column contains
\fBYes\fR
or
\fByes\fR
then the route persists; If the column is empty or contains
\fBNo\fR
or
\fBno\fR
then the route is deleted by
\fBshorewall stop\fR
or
\fBshorewall clear\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Example 1:
.RS 4
Host with IP 155\&.186\&.235\&.6 is connected to interface eth1 and we want hosts attached via eth0 to be able to access it using that address\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
       #ADDRESS        INTERFACE       EXTERNAL
       155\&.186\&.235\&.6   eth1            eth0
