.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The shorewall6 utility is used to control the Shoreline Firewall 6 (Shorewall6)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The
\fBtrace\fR
and
\fBdebug\fR
options are used for debugging\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/starting_and_stopping_shorewall\&.htm#Trace\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
.PP
The
\fBnolock\fR
option prevents the command from attempting to acquire the Shorewall6 lockfile\&. It is useful if you need to include
\fBshorewall6\fR
commands in
/etc/shorewall6/started\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
control the amount of output that the command produces\&. They consist of a sequence of the letters
\fBv\fR
and
\fBq\fR\&. If the options are omitted, the amount of output is determined by the setting of the VERBOSITY parameter in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&. Each
\fBv\fR
adds one to the effective verbosity and each
\fBq\fR
subtracts one from the effective VERBOSITY\&. Alternatively,
\fBv\fR
may be followed immediately with one of \-1,0,1,2 to specify a specify VERBOSITY\&. There may be no white\-space between
\fBv\fR
and the VERBOSITY\&.
.PP
The
\fIoptions\fR
may also include the letter
\fBt\fR
which causes all progress messages to be timestamped\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
The available commands are listed below\&.
.PP
\fBadd \fR{ \fIinterface\fR[:\fIhost\-list\fR]\&.\&.\&. \fIzone\fR | \fIzone\fR \fIhost\-list\fR }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.21\&. Adds a list of hosts or subnets to a dynamic zone usually used with VPN\*(Aqs\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
argument names an interface defined in the
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5) file\&. A
\fIhost\-list\fR
is comma\-separated list whose elements are host or network addresses\&..if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBCaution\fR
.ps -1
.br
The
\fBadd\fR
command is not very robust\&. If there are errors in the
\fIhost\-list\fR, you may see a large number of error messages yet a subsequent
\fBshorewall show zones\fR
command will indicate that all hosts were added\&. If this happens, replace
\fBadd\fR
by
\fBdelete\fR
and run the same command again\&. Then enter the correct command\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.5\&.9, the
\fBdynamic_shared\fR
zone option (\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5)) allows a single ipset to handle entries for multiple interfaces\&. When that option is specified for a zone, the
\fBadd\fR
command has the alternative syntax in which the
\fIzone\fR
name precedes the
\fIhost\-list\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBallow \fR\fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Re\-enables receipt of packets from hosts previously blacklisted by a
\fBdrop\fR,
\fBlogdrop\fR,
\fBreject\fR, or
\fBlogreject\fR
command\&. Beginning with Shorewall 5\&.0\&.10, this command can also re\-enable addresses blacklisted using the
\fBblacklist\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBblacklist\fR \fIaddress\fR [ \fIoption\fR \&.\&.\&. ]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.8 and requires DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST=ipset\&.\&. in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&. Causes packets from the given host or network
\fIaddress\fR
to be dropped, based on the setting of BLACKLIST in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&. The
\fIaddress\fR
along with any
\fIoption\fRs are passed to the
\fBipset add\fR
command\&.
.sp
If the
\fBdisconnect\fR
option is specified in the DYNAMIC_BLACKLISTING setting, then the effective VERBOSITY determines the amount of information displayed:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the effective verbosity is > 0, then a message giving the number of conntrack flows deleted by the command is displayed\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the effective verbosity is > 1, then the conntrack table entries deleted by the command are also displayed\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBcall \fR\fB\fIfunction\fR\fR\fB [ \fR\fB\fIparameter\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&. ]\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.10\&. Allows you to call a function in one of the Shorewall libraries or in your compiled script\&. function must name the shell function to be called\&. The listed parameters are passed to the function\&.
.sp
The function is first searched for in
lib\&.base,
lib\&.common,
lib\&.cli
and
lib\&.cli\-std\&. If it is not found, the call command is passed to the generated script to be executed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcheck \fR[\-\fBe\fR] [\-\fBd\fR] [\-\fBp\fR] [\-\fBr\fR] [\-\fBT\fR] [\-\fBi\fR] [\fIdirectory\fR]
.RS 4
Compiles the configuration in the specified
\fIdirectory\fR
and discards the compiled output script\&. If no
\fIdirectory\fR
is given, then
/etc/shorewall6
is assumed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-e\fR
option causes the compiler to look for a file named capabilities\&. This file is produced using the command
\fBshorewall6\-lite show \-f capabilities > capabilities\fR
on a system with Shorewall6 Lite installed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-d\fR
option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl
\fB\-wd:DProf\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-r\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.2 and causes the compiler to print the generated ruleset to standard out\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-T\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler\-generated error and warning message\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-i\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";")\&. Such lines will be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclear \fR[\-\fBf\fR]
.RS 4
Clear will remove all rules and chains installed by Shorewall6\&. The firewall is then wide open and unprotected\&. Existing connections are untouched\&. Clear is often used to see if the firewall is causing connection problems\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBclose\fR { \fIopen\-number\fR | \fIsource\fR \fIdest\fR [ \fIprotocol\fR [ \fIport\fR ] ] }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.8\&. This command closes a temporary open created by the
\fBopen\fR
command\&. In the first form, an
\fIopen\-number\fR
specifies the open to be closed\&. Open numbers are displayed in the
\fBnum\fR
column of the output of the
\fBshorewall6 show opens \fRcommand\&.
.sp
When the second form of the command is used, the parameters must match those given in the earlier
\fBopen\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcompile \fR[\-\fBe\fR] [\-\fBc\fR] [\-\fBd\fR] [\-\fBp\fR] [\-\fBT\fR] [\-\fBi\fR] [\fIdirectory\fR] [\fIpathname\fR ]
.RS 4
Compiles the current configuration into the executable file
\fIpathname\fR\&. If a directory is supplied, Shorewall6 will look in that directory first for configuration files\&. If the
\fIpathname\fR
is omitted, the file firewall in the VARDIR (normally
/var/lib/shorewall/) is assumed\&. A
\fIpathname\fR
of \*(Aq\-\*(Aq causes the compiler to send the generated script to it\*(Aqs standard output file\&. Note that \*(Aq\-v\-1\*(Aq is usually specified in this case (e\&.g\&.,
\fBshorewall6 \-v\-1 compile \-\- \-\fR) to suppress the \*(AqCompiling\&.\&.\&.\*(Aq message normally generated by
/sbin/shorewall6\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-e\fR
is specified, the compilation is being performed on a system other than where the compiled script will run\&. This option disables certain configuration options that require the script to be compiled where it is to be run\&. The use of
\fB\-e\fR
requires the presence of a configuration file named
capabilities
which may be produced using the command
\fBshorewall6\-lite show \-f capabilities > capabilities\fR
on a system with Shorewall6 Lite installed\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-c\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.17 and causes conditional compilation of a script\&. The script specified by
\fIpathname\fR
(or implied if
\fBpathname\fR
is omitted) is compiled if it doesn\*(Aqt exist or if there is any file in the
\fIdirectory\fR
or in a directory on the CONFIG_PATH that has a modification time later than the file to be compiled\&. When no compilation is needed, a message is issued and an exit status of zero is returned\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-d\fR
option causes the compiler to be run under control of the Perl debugger\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-p\fR
option causes the compiler to be profiled via the Perl
\fB\-wd:DProf\fR
command\-line option\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-T\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20 and causes a Perl stack trace to be included with each compiler\-generated error and warning message\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-i\fR
option was added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.0 and causes a warning message to be issued if the current line contains alternative input specifications following a semicolon (";")\&. Such lines will be handled incorrectly if INLINE_MATCHES is set to Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdelete \fR{ \fIinterface\fR[:\fIhost\-list\fR]\&.\&.\&. \fIzone\fR | \fIzone\fR \fIhost\-list\fR }
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.21\&. The delete command reverses the effect of an earlier
\fBadd\fR
command\&.
.sp
The
\fIinterface\fR
