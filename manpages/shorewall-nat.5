.SH "NAME"
nat \- Shorewall one-to-one NAT file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 19
\fB/etc/shorewall/nat\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define one\-to\-one Network Address Translation (NAT)\&.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
Warning
.PP
If all you want to do is simple port forwarding, do NOT use this file\&. See
\fIhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/FAQ\&.htm#faq1\fR\&[1]\&. Also, in many cases, Proxy ARP (\fIshorewall\-proxyarp\fR\&[2](5)) is a better solution that one\-to\-one NAT\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBEXTERNAL\fR \- {\fIaddress\fR|COMMENT}
.RS 4
External IP Address \- this should NOT be the primary IP address of the interface named in the next column and must not be a DNS Name\&.
.sp
If you put COMMENT in this column, the rest of the line will be attached as a comment to the Netfilter rule(s) generated by the following entries in the file\&. The comment will appear delimited by "/* \&.\&.\&. */" in the output of "shorewall show nat"
.sp
To stop the comment from being attached to further rules, simply include COMMENT on a line by itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterfacelist\fR[\fB:\fR[\fIdigit\fR]]
.RS 4
Interfaces that have the
\fBEXTERNAL\fR
address\&. If ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes in
\fIshorewall\&.conf\fR\&[3](5), Shorewall will automatically add the EXTERNAL address to this interface\&. Also if ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes, you may follow the interface name with ":" and a
\fIdigit\fR
to indicate that you want Shorewall to add the alias with this name (e\&.g\&., "eth0:0")\&. That allows you to see the alias with ifconfig\&.
\fBThat is the only thing that this name is good for \-\- you cannot use it anwhere else in your Shorewall configuration\&. \fR
.sp
Each interface must match an entry in
\fIshorewall\-interfaces\fR\&[4](5)\&. Shorewall allows loose matches to wildcard entries in
\fIshorewall\-interfaces\fR\&[4](5)\&. For example,
\fIppp0\fR
in this file will match a
\fIshorewall\-interfaces\fR\&[4](5) entry that defines
\fIppp+\fR\&.
.sp
If you want to override ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes for a particular entry, follow the interface name with ":" and no digit (e\&.g\&., "eth0:")\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERNAL\fR \- \fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
Internal Address (must not be a DNS Name)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBALL INTERFACES\fR \- [\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR]
.RS 4
If Yes or yes, NAT will be effective from all hosts\&. If No or no (or left empty) then NAT will be effective only through the interface named in the
\fBINTERFACE\fR
column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLOCAL\fR \- [\fBYes\fR|\fBNo\fR]
.RS 4
If
\fBYes\fR
or
\fByes\fR, NAT will be effective from the firewall system
