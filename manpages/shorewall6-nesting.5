nesting \- shorewall6 Nested Zones
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
\fIchild\-zone\fR[:\fIparent\-zone\fR[,\fIparent\-zone\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
In
\fIshorewall6\-zones\fR\&[1](5), a zone may be declared to be a sub\-zone of one or more other zones using the above syntax\&.
.PP
Where zones are nested, the CONTINUE policy in
\fIshorewall6\-policy\fR\&[2](5) allows hosts that are within multiple zones to be managed under the rules of all of these zones\&.

The second entry above says that when Sam is the client, connection requests should first be processed under rules where the source zone is sam and if there is no match then the connection request should be treated under rules where the source zone is net\&. It is important that this policy be listed BEFORE the next policy (net to all)\&. You can have this policy generated for you automatically by using the IMPLICIT_CONTINUE option in
\fIshorewall6\&.conf\fR\&[3](5)\&.

Given these two rules, Sam can connect with ssh to 2001:19f0:feee::3\&. Like all hosts in the net zone, Sam can connect to TCP port 80 on 2001:19f0:feee::5\&. The order of the rules is not significant\&.
