.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fB/etc/shorewall/notrack\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The notrack file is used to exempt certain traffic from Netfilter connection tracking\&. Traffic matching entries in this fill will not be tracked\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
SOURCE \(en {\fIzone\fR[:\fIinterface\fR][:\fIaddress\-list\fR]|COMMENT}
.RS 4
where
\fIzone\fR
is the name of a zone,
\fIinterface\fR
is an interface to that zone, and
\fIaddress\-list\fR
is a comma\-separated list of addresses (may contain exclusion \- see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-exclusion\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
(5))\&.
.sp
Comments may be attached to Netfilter rules generated from entries in this file through the use of COMMENT lines\&. These lines begin with the word COMMENT; the remainder of the line is treated as a comment which is attached to subsequent rules until another COMMENT line is found or until the end of the file is reached\&. To stop adding comments to rules, use a line with only the word COMMENT\&.
.RE
.PP
DEST \(en [\fIinterface\fR|\fIaddress\-list\fR]
.RS 4
where
\fIinterface\fR
is the name of a network interface and
\fIaddress\-list\fR
is a comma\-separated list of addresses (may contain exclusion \- see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-exclusion\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
(5))\&. If an interface is given:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
It must be up and configured with an IPv4 address when Shorewall is started or restarted\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
All routes out of the interface must be configured when Shorewall is started or restarted\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Default routes out of the interface will result in a warning message and will be ignored\&.
.RE
.RS 4
These restrictions are because Netfilter doesn\'t support NOTRACK rules that specify a destination interface (these rules are applied before packets are routed and hence the destination interface is unknown)\&. Shorewall uses the routes out of the interface to replace the interface with an address list corresponding to the networks routed out of the named interface\&.
.RE
.PP
PROTO \(en \fIprotocol\-name\-or\-number\fR
.RS 4
A protocol name from
/etc/protocols
or a protocol number\&.
.RE
.PP
DEST PORT(S) \- port\-number/service\-name\-list
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
/etc/services\&. May also include port ranges of the form
\fIlow\-port\fR:\fIhigh\-port\fR
if your kernel and iptables include port range support\&.
.RE
.PP
SOURCE PORT(S) \- port\-number/service\-name\-list
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from
/etc/services\&. May also include port ranges of the form
\fIlow\-port\fR:\fIhigh\-port\fR
if your kernel and iptables include port range support\&.
.RE
.PP
USER/GROUP \(en [\fIuser\fR][:\fIgroup\fR]
.RS 4
May only be specified if the SOURCE
\fIzone\fR
is $FW\&. Specifies the effective user id and or group id of the process sending the traffic\&.
