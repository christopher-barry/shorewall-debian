tcpri \- Shorewall6 file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 22
\fB/etc/shorewall6/tcpri\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to specify the priority band of traffic for simple traffic shaping (TC_ENABLED=Simple in
\fIshorewall6\&.conf\fR\&[1](5))\&. The priority band of each packet is determined by the
\fBlast\fR
entry that the packet matches\&. If a packet doesn\'t match any entry in this file, then its priority will be determined by its TOS field\&. The default mapping is as follows but can be changed by setting the TC_PRIOMAP option in
\fIshorewall6\&.conf\fR\&[1](5)\&.

The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBBAND\fR \- {\fB1\fR|\fB2\fR|\fB3\fR}
.RS 4
Classifies matching traffic as High Priority (1), Medium Priority (2) or Low Priority (3)\&. For those interfaces listed in
\fIshorewall6\-tcinterfaces\fR\&[2](5), Priority 2 traffic will be deferred so long and there is Priority 1 traffic queued and Priority 3 traffic will be deferred so long as there is Priority 1 or Priority 2 traffic to send\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPROTO\fR \- \fIprotocol\fR
.RS 4
Optional\&. The name or number of an IPv4
\fIprotocol\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
PORT(S) \- \fIport\fR [,\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
Optional\&. May only be given if the the PROTO is TCP (6), UDP (17), DCCP (33), SCTP (132) or UDPLITE (136)\&. A list of one or more port numbers or service names from /etc/services\&. Port ranges of the form
\fIlowport\fR:\fIhighport\fR
may also be included\&.
.RE
.PP
ADDRESS \- [\fIaddress\fR]
.RS 4
Optional\&. The IP or MAC address that the traffic originated from\&. MAC addresses must be given in Shorewall format\&. If this column contains an address, then the PROTO, PORT(S) and INTERFACE column must be empty ("\-")\&.
.RE
.PP
INTERFACE \- [\fIinterface\fR]
.RS 4
Optional\&. The logical name of an
\fIinterface\fR
that traffic arrives from\&. If given, the PROTO, PORT(S) and ADDRESS columns must be empty ("\-")\&.

.nr an-no-space-flag 1

Note
INTERFACE classification of packets occurs before classification by PROTO/PORT(S)/ADDRESS\&. So it is highly recommended to place entries that specify INTERFACE at the top of the file so that the rule about
\fIlast entry matches\fR
is preserved\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHELPER\fR \- [\fIhelper\fR]
.RS 4
Optional\&. Names a Netfiler protocol helper module such as ftp, sip, amanda, etc\&. A packet will match if it was accepted by the named helper module\&. You can also append "\-" and a port number to the helper module name (e\&.g\&., ftp\-21) to specify the port number that the original connection was made on\&.
