tcdevices \- Shorewall6 Traffic Shaping Devices file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 26
\fB/etc/shorewall6/tcdevices\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Entries in this file define the bandwidth for interfaces on which you want traffic shaping to be enabled\&.
.PP
If you do not plan to use traffic shaping for a device, don\'t put it in here as it limits the throughput of that device to the limits you set here\&.
.PP
A note on the
\fIbandwidth\fR
definitions used in this file:

.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- [\fInumber\fR:]\fIinterface\fR
.RS 4
Name of
\fIinterface\fR\&. Each interface may be listed only once in this file\&. You may NOT specify the name of an alias (e\&.g\&., eth0:0) here; see
\fIhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/FAQ\&.htm#faq18\fR
.sp
You may NOT specify wildcards here, e\&.g\&. if you have multiple ppp interfaces, you need to put them all in here!
.sp
If the device doesn\'t exist, a warning message will be issued during "shorewall6 [re]start" and "shorewall6 refresh" and traffic shaping configuration will be skipped for that device\&.
.sp
Shorewall6 assigns a sequential
interface number
to each interface (the first entry in the file is interface 1, the second is interface 2 and so on) Beginning with Shorewall6\-perl 4\&.1\&.6, you can explicitly specify the interface number by prefixing the interface name with the number and a colon (":")\&. Example: 1:eth0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBIN\-BANDWIDTH\fR \- \fIbandwidth\fR
.RS 4
The incoming
\fIbandwidth\fR
of that interface\&. Please note that you are not able to do traffic shaping on incoming traffic, as the traffic is already received before you could do so\&. But this allows you to define the maximum traffic allowed for this interface in total, if the rate is exceeded, the packets are dropped\&. You want this mainly if you have a DSL or Cable connection to avoid queuing at your providers side\&.
.sp
If you don\'t want any traffic to be dropped, set this to a value to zero in which case Shorewall6 will not create an ingress qdisc\&.Must be set to zero if the REDIRECTED INTERFACES column is non\-empty\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOUT\-BANDWIDTH\fR \- \fIbandwidth\fR
.RS 4
The outgoing
\fIbandwidth\fR
of that interface\&. This is the maximum speed your connection can handle\&. It is also the speed you can refer as "full" if you define the tc classes in
\fIshorewall6\-tcclasses\fR\&[1](5)\&. Outgoing traffic above this rate will be dropped\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOPTIONS\fR \- {\fB\-\fR|\fB{classify\fR|hfsc} ,\&.\&.\&.}
.RS 4
\fBclassify\fR
\(em When specified, Shorewall will not generate tc or Netfilter rules to classify traffic based on packet marks\&. You must do all classification using CLASSIFY rules in
\fIshorewall\-tcrules\fR\&[2](5)\&.
.sp
\fBhfsc\fR
\- Shorewall normally uses the
Hierarchical Token Bucket
queuing discipline\&. When
\fBhfsc\fR
is specified, the
Hierarchical Fair Service Curves
discipline is used instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBREDIRECTED INTERFACES\fR \- [\fIinterface\fR[,\fIinterface\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall6\-perl 4\&.1\&.6\&. May only be specified if the interface in the INTERFACE column is an Intermediate Frame Block (IFB) device\&. Causes packets that enter each listed interface to be passed through the egress filters defined for this device, thus providing a form of incoming traffic shaping\&. When this column is non\-empty, the
\fBclassify\fR
option is assumed\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Example 1:
.RS 4
Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL) and ppp0 is the interface for this\&. The device has an outgoing bandwidth of 500kbit and an incoming bandwidth of 6000kbit
