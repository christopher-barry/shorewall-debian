.SH "NAME"
tunnels \- Shorewall6 VPN definition file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 24
\fB/etc/shorewall6/tunnels\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The tunnels file is used to define rules for encapsulated (usually encrypted) traffic to pass between the Shorewall6 system and a remote gateway\&. Traffic flowing through the tunnel is handled using the normal zone/policy/rule mechanism\&. See
\fIhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/VPNBasics\&.html\fR
for details\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.

.RE
If the type is
\fBipsec\fR, it may be followed by
\fB:ah\fR
to indicate that the Authentication Headers protocol (51) is used by the tunnel (the default is
\fB:noah\fR
which means that protocol 51 is not used)\&. NAT traversal is only supported with ESP (protocol 50) so
\fBipsecnat\fR
tunnels don\'t allow the
\fBah\fR
option (\fBipsecnat:noah\fR
may be specified but is redundant)\&.
.sp
If type is
\fBopenvpn\fR,
\fBopenvpnclient\fR
or
\fBopenvpnserver\fR
it may optionally be followed by ":" and
\fBtcp\fR
or
\fBudp\fR
to specify the protocol to be used\&. If not specified,
\fBudp\fR
is assumed\&. Note: At this writing, OpenVPN does not support IPv6\&.
.sp
If type is
\fBopenvpn\fR,
\fBopenvpnclient\fR
or
\fBopenvpnserver\fR
it may optionally be followed by ":" and the port number used by the tunnel\&. if no ":" and port number are included, then the default port of 1194 will be used\&. \&. Where both the protocol and port are specified, the protocol must be given first (e\&.g\&., openvpn:tcp:4444)\&.
.sp
If type is
\fBgeneric\fR, it must be followed by ":" and a protocol name (from /etc/protocols) or a protocol number\&. If the protocol is
\fBtcp\fR
or
\fBudp\fR
(6 or 17), then it may optionally be followed by ":" and a port number\&.

\fBZONE\fR \- \fIzone\fR
.RS 4
The
\fIzone\fR
of the physical interface through which tunnel traffic passes\&. This is normally your internet zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGATEWAY\fR \- \fIaddress\-or\-range\fR
.RS 4
The IP address of the remote tunnel gateway\&. If the remote gateway has no fixed address (Road Warrior) then specify the gateway as
\fB::/0\fR\&. May be specified as a network address and if your kernel and ip6tables include iprange match support then IP address ranges are also allowed\&.

\fBGATEWAY ZONES\fR (Optional) \- [\fIzone\fR[\fB,\fR\fIzone\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
If the gateway system specified in the third column is a standalone host then this column should contain a comma\-separated list of the names of the zones that the host might be in\&. This column only applies to IPSEC tunnels where it enables ISAKMP traffic to flow through the tunnel to the remote gateway\&.
