.SH "NAME"
maclist \- shorewall6 MAC Verification file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 24
\fB/etc/shorewall6/maclist\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define the MAC addresses and optionally their associated IPv6 addresses to be allowed to use the specified interface\&. The feature is enabled by using the
\fBmaclist\fR
option in the
\fIshorewall6\-interfaces\fR\&[1](5) or
\fIshorewall6\-hosts\fR\&[2](5) configuration file\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBDISPOSITION\fR \- {\fBACCEPT\fR|\fBDROP\fR|\fBREJECT\fR}[\fB:\fR\fIlog\-level\fR]
.RS 4
\fBACCEPT\fR
or
\fBDROP\fR
(if MACLIST_TABLE=filter in
\fIshorewall6\&.conf\fR\&[3](5), then REJECT is also allowed)\&. If specified, the
\fIlog\-level\fR
causes packets matching the rule to be logged at that level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR
.RS 4
Network
\fIinterface\fR
to a host\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMAC\fR \- \fIaddress\fR
.RS 4
MAC
\fIaddress\fR
of the host \-\- you do not need to use the shorewall6 format for MAC addresses here\&. If
\fBIP ADDRESSESES\fR
is supplied then
\fBMAC\fR
can be supplied as a dash (\fB\-\fR)
.RE
.PP
\fBIP ADDRESSES\fR (Optional) \- [\fIaddress\fR[\fB,\fR\fIaddress\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
If specified, both the MAC and IP address must match\&. This column can contain a comma\-separated list of host and/or subnet addresses\&. If your kernel and ip6tables have iprange match support then IP address ranges are also allowed\&. Similarly, if your kernel and ip6tables include ipset support than set names (prefixed by "+") are also allowed\&.
