.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting rules exist simply to count packets and bytes in categories that you define in this file\&. You may display these rules and their packet and byte counters using the
\fBshorewall show accounting\fR
command\&.
.PP
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.18, the accounting structure can be created with three root chains:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBaccountin\fR: Rules that are valid in the
\fBINPUT\fR
chain (may not specify an output interface)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBaccountout\fR: Rules that are valid in the OUTPUT chain (may not specify an input interface or a MAC address)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBaccounting\fR: Other rules\&.
.RE
.PP
The new structure is enabled by sectioning the accounting file in a manner similar to the
\m[blue]\fBrules file\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&. The sections are
\fBINPUT\fR,
\fBOUTPUT\fR
and
\fBFORWARD\fR
and must appear in that order (although any of them may be omitted)\&. The first non\-commentary record in the accounting file must be a section header when sectioning is used\&.

If sections are not used, the Shorewall rules compiler cannot detect certain violations of netfilter restrictions\&. These violations can result in run\-time errors such as the following:
.PP
\fBiptables\-restore v1\&.4\&.13: Can\*(Aqt use \-o with INPUT\fR
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.20, the ACCOUNTING_TABLE setting was added to shorewall\&.conf and shorewall6\&.conf\&. That setting determines the Netfilter table (filter or mangle) where the accounting rules are added\&. When ACCOUNTING_TABLE=mangle is specified, the available sections are
\fBPREROUTING\fR,
\fBINPUT\fR,
\fBOUTPUT\fR,
\fBFORWARD\fR
and
\fBPOSTROUTING\fR\&.
.PP
Section headers have the form:
.PP
\fB[?]SECTION\fR
\fIsection\-name\fR
.PP
The optional "?" was added in Shorewalll 4\&.6\&.0 and is preferred\&. Existing configurations may be converted to use this form using the
\fBshorewall update\fR
command\&.
.PP
When sections are enabled:
.sp

.ie n \{\

\fBACTION\fR \- {\fBCOUNT\fR|\fBDONE\fR|\fIchain\fR[:\fB{COUNT\fR|JUMP}]|ACCOUNT(\fItable\fR,\fInetwork\fR)|[?]COMMENT \fIcomment\fR}

What to do when a matching packet is found\&.
.PP
\fBCOUNT\fR
.RS 4
Simply count the match and continue with the next rule
.RE
.PP
\fBDONE\fR
.RS 4
Count the match and don\*(Aqt attempt to match any other accounting rules in the chain specified in the
\fBCHAIN\fR
column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIchain\fR[\fB:\fR\fBCOUNT\fR]
.RS 4
Where
\fIchain\fR
is the name of a chain; shorewall will create the chain automatically if it doesn\*(Aqt already exist\&. If a second chain is mentioned in the CHAIN column, then a jump from this second chain to
\fIchain\fR
is created\&. If no chain is named in the CHAIN column, then a jump from the default chain to
\fIchain\fR
is created\&. If
\fB:COUNT\fR
is included, a counting rule matching this entry will be added to
\fIchain\fR\&. The
\fIchain\fR
may not exceed 29 characters in length and may be composed of letters, digits, dash (\*(Aq\-\*(Aq) and underscore (\*(Aq_\*(Aq)\&.
.RE

.RS 4
Like the previous option without the
\fB:COUNT\fR
part\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBACCOUNT(\fR\fItable\fR,\fInetwork\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
This action implements per\-IP accounting and was added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.17\&. Requires the
\fIACCOUNT Target\fR
capability in your iptables and kernel (see the output of
\fBshorewall show capabilities\fR)\&.
.PP
\fItable\fR
.RS 4
is the name of an accounting table (you choose the name)\&. All rules specifying the same name will have their per\-IP counters accumulated in the same table\&.
.RE
.PP
\fInetwork\fR
.RS 4
is an IPv4
\fBnetwork\fR
in CIDR notation (e\&.g\&., 192\&.168\&.1\&.0/24)\&. The network can be as large as a /8 (class A)\&.
.RE
.sp
One nice feature of per\-IP accounting is that the counters survive
\fBshorewall restart\fR\&. This has a downside, however\&. If you change the network associated with an accounting table, then you must
\fBshorewall stop; shorewall start\fR
to have a successful restart (counters will be cleared)\&.
.sp
The counters in a
\fItable\fR
are printed using the
\fBiptaccount\fR
utility\&. For a command synopsis, type:
.sp
\fBiptaccount \-\-help\fR
.sp
As of February 2011, the ACCOUNT Target capability and the iptaccount utility are only available when
\m[blue]\fBxtables\-addons\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2
is installed\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/Accounting\&.html#perIP\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
for additional information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINLINE\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16\&. Allows free form iptables matches to be specified following a \*(Aq;\*(Aq\&. In the generated iptables rule(s), the free form matches will follow any matches that are generated by the column contents\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFACCT\fR({\fIobject\fR[!]}[,\&.\&.\&.])
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.7\&. Provides a form of accounting that survives
\fBshorewall stop/shorewall\fR
start and
\fBshorewall restart\fR\&. Requires the NFaccnt Match capability in your kernel and iptables\&.
\fIobject\fR
names an nfacct object (see man nfaccnt(8))\&. Multiple rules can specify the same
\fIobject\fR; all packets that match any of the rules increment the packet and bytes count of the object\&.
.sp
Prior to Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16, only one
\fIobject\fR
could be specified\&. Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16, an arbitrary number of objects may be given\&.
.sp
With Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16 or later, an nfacct
\fIobject\fR
in the list may optionally be followed by
\fB!\fR
to indicate that the nfacct
\fIobject\fR
will be incremented unconditionally for each packet\&. When
\fB!\fR
is omitted, the
\fIobject\fR
will be incremented only if all of the matches in the rule succeed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFLOG\fR[(nflog\-parameters)] \- Added in Shorewall\-4\&.4\&.20\&.
.RS 4
Causes each matching packet to be sent via the currently loaded logging back\-end (usually nfnetlink_log) where it is available to accounting daemons through a netlink socket\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[?]COMMENT\fR
.RS 4
The remainder of the line is treated as a comment which is attached to subsequent rules until another COMMENT line is found or until the end of the file is reached\&. To stop adding comments to rules, use a line with only the word COMMENT\&.

Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.5\&.15, you may place \*(Aq=\*(Aq in this column, provided that the DEST PORT(S) column is non\-empty\&.
