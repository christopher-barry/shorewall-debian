.SH "NAME"
actions \- Shorewall action declaration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 23
\fB/etc/shorewall/actions\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file allows you to define new ACTIONS for use in rules (see
\fIshorewall\-rules(5)\fR\&[1])\&. You define the iptables rules to be performed in an ACTION in /etc/shorewall/action\&.\fIaction\-name\fR\&.
.PP
ACTION names should begin with an upper\-case letter to distinguish them from Shorewall\-generated chain names and they must meet the requirements of a Netfilter chain\&. If you intend to log from the action then the name must be no longer than 11 characters in length\&. Names must also meet the requirements for a Bourne Shell identifier (must begin with a letter and be composed of letters, digits and underscore characters)\&.
