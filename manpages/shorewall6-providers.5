.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is used to define additional routing tables\&. You will want to define an additional table if:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You have connections to more than one ISP or multiple connections to the same ISP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You run Squid as a transparent proxy on a host other than the firewall\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
You have other requirements for policy routing\&.
.RE
.PP
Each entry in the file defines a single routing table\&.
.PP
If you wish to omit a column entry but want to include an entry in the next column, use "\-" for the omitted entry\&.
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBNAME\fR \- \fIname\fR
.RS 4
The provider
\fIname\fR\&. Must be a valid shell variable name\&. The names \'local\', \'main\', \'default\' and \'unspec\' are reserved and may not be used as provider names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNUMBER\fR \- \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
The provider number \-\- a number between 1 and 15\&. Each provider must be assigned a unique value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMARK\fR (Optional) \- \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
A FWMARK
\fIvalue\fR
used in your
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-tcrules(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
file to direct packets to this provider\&.
.sp
If HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2, then the value must be a multiple of 256 between 256 and 65280 or their hexadecimal equivalents (0x0100 and 0xff00 with the low\-order byte of the value being zero)\&. Otherwise, the value must be between 1 and 255\&. Each provider must be assigned a unique mark value\&. This column may be omitted if you don\'t use packet marking to direct connections to a particular provider and you don\'t specify
\fBtrack\fR
in the OPTIONS column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDUPLICATE\fR \- \fIrouting\-table\-name\fR
.RS 4
The name of an existing table to duplicate to create this routing table\&. May be
\fBmain\fR
or the name of a previously listed provider\&. You may select only certain entries from the table to copy by using the COPY column below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINTERFACE\fR \- \fIinterface\fR
.RS 4
The name of the network interface to the provider\&. Must be listed in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-interfaces(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGATEWAY\fR \- {\fB\-\fR|\fIaddress\fR|\fBdetect\fR}
.RS 4
The IP address of the provider\'s gateway router\&.
.sp
You can enter "detect" here and Shorewall6 will attempt to detect the gateway automatically\&.
.sp
For PPP devices, you may omit this column\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOPTIONS\fR (Optional) \- [\fB\-\fR|\fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fIoption\fR]\&.\&.\&.]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list selected from the following\&. The order of the options is not significant but the list may contain no embedded whitespace\&.
.PP
\fBtrack\fR
.RS 4
If specified, inbound connections on this interface are to be tracked so that responses may be routed back out this same interface\&.
.sp
You want to specify
\fBtrack\fR
if internet hosts will be connecting to local servers through this provider\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.3,
\fBtrack\fR
defaults to the setting of the TRACK_PROVIDERS option in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2
(5)\&. If you set TRACK_PROVIDERS=Yes and want to override that setting for an individual provider, then specify
\fBnotrack\fR
(see below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBloose\fR
.RS 4
Shorewall6 normally adds a routing rule for each IP address on an interface which forces traffic whose source is that IP address to be sent using the routing table for that interface\&. Setting
\fBloose\fR
prevents creation of such rules on this interface\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnotrack\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.3\&. When specified, turns off
\fBtrack\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoptional\fR
.RS 4
If the interface named in the INTERFACE column is not up and configured with an IPv4 address then ignore this provider\&. If not specified, the value of the
\fBoptional\fR
option for the INTERFACE in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall6\-interfaces(5)\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
src=\fIsource\-address\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the source address to use when routing to this provider and none is known (the local client has bound to the 0 address)\&. May not be specified when an
\fIaddress\fR
is given in the INTERFACE column\&. If this option is not used, Shorewall6 substitutes the primary IP address on the interface named in the INTERFACE column\&.
.RE
.PP
mtu=\fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the MTU when forwarding through this provider\&. If not given, the MTU of the interface named in the INTERFACE column is assumed\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBCOPY\fR \- [{\fBnone\fR|\fIinterface\fR\fB[,\fR\fIinterface\fR]\&.\&.\&.}]
.RS 4
A comma\-separated list of other interfaces on your firewall\&. Wildcards specified using an asterisk ("*") are permitted (e\&.g\&., tun* )\&. Usually used only when DUPLICATE is
\fBmain\fR\&. Only copy routes through INTERFACE and through interfaces listed here\&. If you only wish to copy routes through INTERFACE, enter
\fBnone\fR
in this column\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Example 1:
.RS 4
You run squid in your DMZ on IP address 2002:ce7c:92b4:1::2\&. Your DMZ interface is eth2
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        #NAME   NUMBER  MARK DUPLICATE  INTERFACE GATEWAY              OPTIONS
        Squid   1       1    \-          eth2      2002:ce7c:92b4:1::2  \-

.if n \{\

.\}
.RE
.PP
Example 2:
.RS 4
eth0 connects to ISP 1\&. The ISP\'s gateway router has IP address 2001:ce7c:92b4:1::2\&.
.sp
eth1 connects to ISP 2\&. The ISP\'s gateway router has IP address 2001:d64c:83c9:12::8b\&.
.sp
eth2 connects to a local network\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
