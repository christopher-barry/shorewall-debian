.PP
Entries in this file govern connection establishment by defining exceptions to the policies layed out in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-policy\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)\&. By default, subsequent requests and responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking\&. For any particular (source,dest) pair of zones, the rules are evaluated in the order in which they appear in this file and the first terminating match is the one that determines the disposition of the request\&. All rules are terminating except LOG and COUNT rules\&.

When defining rules that rewrite the destination IP address and/or port number (namely DNAT and REDIRECT rules), it is important to keep straight which columns in the file specify the packet before rewriting and which specify how the packet will look after rewriting\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

The DEST column specifies the final destination for the packet after rewriting and can include the final IP address and/or port number\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

The remaining columns specify characteristics of the packet before rewriting\&. In particular, the ORIGINAL DEST column gives the original destination IP address of the packet and the DEST PORT(S) column give the original destination port(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows\&.
.PP
\fBACTION\fR \- \fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB[:\fR{\fIlog\-level\fR|\fBnone\fR}[\fB\fB!\fR\fR][\fB:\fR\fItag\fR]]

.RE
.PP

\fBLOG\fR

Simply log the packet and continue with the next rule\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fImacro\fR\fB[(\fR\fB\fImacrotarget\fR\fR\fB)]\fR
.RS 4
The name of a macro defined in a file named macro\&.\fImacro\fR\&. If the macro accepts an action parameter (Look at the macro source to see if it has PARAM in the TARGET column) then the
\fImacro\fR
name is followed by the parenthesized
\fImacrotarget\fR

\fBDROP\fR,
\fBREJECT\fR, \&.\&.\&.) to be substituted for the parameter\&.
.sp
Example: FTP(ACCEPT)\&.

The older syntax where the macro name and the target are separated by a slash (e\&.g\&. FTP/ACCEPT) is still allowed but is deprecated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBADD(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes addresses and/or port numbers to be added to the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tupple to be added to the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be added using
\fIflags\fR
\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-A command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
ADD is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDEL(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes an entry to be deleted from the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tupple to be deleted from the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be deletec using
\fIflags\fR
\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-D command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
DEL is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.sp
The
\fItarget\fR
may optionally be followed by ":" and a syslog log level (e\&.g, REJECT:info or Web(ACCEPT):debug)\&. This causes the packet to be logged at the specified level\&. Note that if the
\fBACTION\fR
involves destination network address translation (DNAT, REDIRECT, etc\&.) then the packet is logged
\fBbefore\fR
the destination address is rewritten\&.
.sp
If the
\fBACTION\fR
names an
\fIaction\fR
declared in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2(5) or in /usr/share/shorewall/actions\&.std then:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

If the log level is followed by "!\*(Aq then all rules in the action are logged at the log level\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

The special log level
\fBnone!\fR
suppresses logging by the action\&.
.RE
.sp
You may also specify
\fBULOG\fR
or
\fBNFLOG\fR
(must be in upper case) as a log level\&.This will log to the ULOG or NFLOG target for routing to a separate log through use of ulogd (\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.netfilter\&.org/projects/ulogd/index\&.html\fR\m[])\&.
.sp
Actions specifying logging may be followed by a log tag (a string of alphanumeric characters) which is appended to the string generated by the LOGPREFIX (in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5))\&.
.sp
Example: ACCEPT:info:ftp would include \*(Aqftp \*(Aq at the end of the log prefix generated by the LOGPREFIX setting\&.

Source hosts to which the rule applies\&. May be a

\fBall\fR,
\fBall+\fR,
\fBall\-\fR,
\fBall+\-\fR
or
\fBnone\fR\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13, you may use a
\fIzone\-list \fRwhich consists of a comma\-separated list of zones declared in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2
(5)\&. Ths
\fIzone\-list\fR
may be optionally followed by "+" to indicate that the rule is to apply to intra\-zone traffic as well as inter\-zone traffic\&.
.sp
When
\fBnone\fR
is used either in the
\fBSOURCE\fR
or
\fBDEST\fR
column, the rule is ignored\&.
.sp
\fBall\fR
means "All Zones", including the firewall itself\&.
\fBall\-\fR
means "All Zones, except the firewall itself"\&. When
\fBall\fR[\fB\-\fR] is used either in the
\fBSOURCE\fR
or
\fBDEST\fR
column intra\-zone traffic is not affected\&. When
\fBall+\fR[\fB\-\fR] is "used, intra\-zone traffic is affected\&. Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.13, exclusion is supported \-\- see see
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-exclusion\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[7]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Except when
\fBall\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] or
\fBany\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] is specified, clients may be further restricted to a list of networks and/or hosts by appending ":" and a comma\-separated list of network and/or host addresses\&. Hosts may be specified by IP or MAC address; mac addresses must begin with "~" and must use "\-" as a separator\&.
.sp
The above restriction on
\fBall\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] and
\fBany\fR[\fB+\fR][\fB\-\fR] is removed in Shorewall\-4\&.4\&.13\&.
.sp
\fBany\fR
is equivalent to
\fBall\fR
when there are no nested zones\&. When there are nested zones,
\fBany\fR
only refers to top\-level zones (those with no parent zones)\&. Note that
\fBany\fR
excludes all vserver zones, since those zones are nested within the firewall zone\&.
.sp
Hosts may also be specified as an IP address range using the syntax
\fIlowaddress\fR\-\fIhighaddress\fR\&. This requires that your kernel and iptables contain iprange match support\&. If your kernel and iptables have ipset match support then you may give the name of an ipset prefaced by "+"\&. The ipset name may be optionally followed by a number from 1 to 6 enclosed in square brackets ([]) to indicate the number of levels of source bindings to be matched\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.4\&.17, the primary IP address of a firewall interface can be specified by an apersand (\*(Aq&\*(Aq) followed by the logican name of the interface as found in the INTERFACE column of
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-interfaces\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[8]\d\s+2

A comma\-separated list of addresses may also be used\&. This is most useful with the

For other actions, this column may be included and may contain one or more addresses (host or network) separated by commas\&. Address ranges are not allowed\&.

It is also possible to specify a set of addresses then exclude part of those addresses\&. For example,
