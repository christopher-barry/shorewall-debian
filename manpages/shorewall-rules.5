Entries in this file govern connection establishment by defining exceptions to the policies laid out in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-policy\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2(5)\&. By default, subsequent requests and responses are automatically allowed using connection tracking\&. For any particular (source,dest) pair of zones, the rules are evaluated in the order in which they appear in this file and the first terminating match is the one that determines the disposition of the request\&. All rules are terminating except LOG and COUNT rules\&.

The rules file is divided into sections\&. Each section is introduced by a "Section Header" which is a line beginning with ?SECTION and followed by the section name\&.
.PP
Sections are as follows and must appear in the order listed:

When defining rules that rewrite the destination IP address and/or port number (namely DNAT and REDIRECT rules), it is important to keep straight which columns in the file specify the packet before rewriting and which specify how the packet will look after rewriting\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The DEST column specifies the final destination for the packet after rewriting and can include the final IP address and/or port number\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The remaining columns specify characteristics of the packet before rewriting\&. In particular, the ORIGDEST column gives the original destination IP address of the packet and the DPORT column give the original destination port(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate specification syntax)\&.
.PP
\fBACTION\fR \- \fB\fItarget\fR\fR\fB[:\fR{\fIlog\-level\fR|\fBnone\fR}[\fB\fB!\fR\fR][\fB:\fR\fItag\fR]]
.RS 4
Specifies the action to be taken if the connection request matches the rule\&.
\fItarget\fR
must be one of the following\&.

.PP
\fIaction\fR
.RS 4
The name of an

.RE
.PP
\fBADD(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB[:\fR\fB\fItimeout\fR\fR\fB])\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes addresses and/or port numbers to be added to the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be added to the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be added using
\fIflags\fR\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-A command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
Beginning with Shorewall 5\&.0\&.3, an optional
\fItimeout\fR
can be specified\&. This is the number of seconds that the new entry in the ipset is to remain valid and overrides any timeout specified when the ipset was created\&.
.sp
ADD is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAUDIT\fR[(accept|drop|reject)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.10\&. Audits the packet with the specified type; if the type is omitted, then
\fBdrop\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBA_ACCEPT\fR, \fBA_ACCEPT\fR\fB+\fR and \fBA_ACCEPT\fR\fB!\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB?COMMENT\fR
.RS 4
the rest of the line will be attached as a comment to the Netfilter rule(s) generated by the following entries\&. The comment will appear delimited by "/* \&.\&.\&. */" in the output of "shorewall show <chain>"\&. To stop the comment from being attached to further rules, simply include ?COMMENT on a line by itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONMARK({\fR\fB\fImark\fR\fR\fB})\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.7, CONNMARK is identical to MARK with the exception that the mark is assigned to connection to which the packet belongs is marked rather than to the packet itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE\fR
.RS 4
For experts only\&.
.sp
Do not process any of the following rules for this (source zone,destination zone)\&. If the source and/or destination IP address falls into a zone defined later in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-zones\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2(5) or in a parent zone of the source or destination zones, then this connection request will be passed to the rules defined for that (those) zone(s)\&. See
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-nesting\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[5]\d\s+2(5) for additional information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCONTINUE!\fR
.RS 4
like CONTINUE but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in

.RE
.PP
\fBDEL(\fR\fB\fIipset\fR\fR\fB:\fR\fB\fIflags\fR\fR\fB)\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.4\&.12\&. Causes an entry to be deleted from the named
\fIipset\fR\&. The
\fIflags\fR
specify the address or tuple to be deleted from the set and must match the type of ipset involved\&. For example, for an iphash ipset, either the SOURCE or DESTINATION address can be deleted using
\fIflags\fR\fBsrc\fR
or
\fBdst\fR
respectively (see the \-D command in ipset (8))\&.
.sp
DEL is non\-terminating\&. Even if a packet matches the rule, it is passed on to the next rule\&.

iptables rule and not the companion
\fBACCEPT\fR
rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDROP\fR
.RS 4
Ignore the request\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDROP!\fR
.RS 4
like DROP but exempts the rule from being suppressed by OPTIMIZE=1 in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\&.conf\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBHELPER\fR
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.7\&. This action requires that the HELPER column contains the name of the Netfilter helper to be associated with connections matching this connection\&. May only be specified in the NEW section and is useful for being able to specify a helper when the applicable policy is ACCEPT\&. No destination zone should be specified in HELPER rules\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBINLINE\fR[(\fIaction\fR)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.16\&. This action allows you to construct most of the rule yourself using iptables syntax\&. The part that you specify must follow a semicolon (\*(Aq;\*(Aq) and is completely free\-form\&. If the target of the rule (the part following \*(Aqj\*(Aq) is something that Shorewall supports in the ACTION column, then you may enclose it in parentheses (e\&.g\&., INLINE(ACCEPT))\&. Otherwise, you can include it after the semicolon\&. In this case, you must declare the target as a builtin action in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5)\&.
.sp
Some considerations when using INLINE:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The
\fBp\fR,
\fBs\fR,
\fBd\fR,
\fBi\fR,
\fBo\fR,
\fBpolicy\fR, and state match (\fBstate\fR
or
\fBconntrack \-\-ctstate\fR) matches will always appear in the front of the rule in that order\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
When multiple matches are specified, the compiler will keep them in the order in which they appear (excluding the above listed ones), but they will not necessarily be at the end of the generated rule\&. For example, if addresses are specified in the SOURCE and/or DEST columns, their generated matches will appear after those specified using \*(Aq;\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBIPTABLES\fR({\fIiptables\-target\fR [\fIoption\fR \&.\&.\&.])
.RS 4
This action allows you to specify an iptables target with options (e\&.g\&., \*(AqIPTABLES(MARK \-\-set\-xmark 0x01/0xff)\*(Aq\&. If the
\fIiptables\-target\fR
is not one recognized by Shorewall, the following error message will be issued:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    ERROR: Unknown target (\fIiptables\-target\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This error message may be eliminated by adding the
\fIiptables\-\fR\fItarget\fR
as a builtin action in
\m[blue]\fBshorewall\-actions\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[3]\d\s+2(5)\&.

.br
If you specify REJECT as the
\fIiptables\-target\fR, the target of the rule will be the iptables REJECT target and not Shorewall\*(Aqs builtin \*(Aqreject\*(Aq chain which is used when REJECT (see below) is specified as the
\fItarget\fR

\fImacro\fR\fB[(\fR\fB\fImacrotarget\fR\fR\fB)]\fR
.RS 4
The name of a macro defined in a file named macro\&.\fImacro\fR\&. If the macro accepts an action parameter (Look at the macro source to see if it has PARAM in the TARGET column) then the
\fImacro\fR
name is followed by the parenthesized
\fImacrotarget\fR
(\fBACCEPT\fR,
\fBDROP\fR,
\fBREJECT\fR, \&.\&.\&.) to be substituted for the parameter\&.
.sp
Example: FTP(ACCEPT)\&.
.sp
The older syntax where the macro name and the target are separated by a slash (e\&.g\&. FTP/ACCEPT) is still allowed but is deprecated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMARK({\fR\fB\fImark\fR\fR\fB})\fR
.RS 4
where
\fImark\fR
is a packet mark value\&.
.sp
Added in Shorewall 5\&.0\&.7, MARK requires "Mark in filter table" support in your kernel and iptables\&.
.sp
Normally will set the mark value of the current packet\&. If preceded by a vertical bar ("|"), the mark value will be logically ORed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&. If preceded by an ampersand ("&"), will be logically ANDed with the current mark value to produce a new mark value\&.
.sp
Both "|" and "&" require Extended MARK Target support in your kernel and iptables\&.
.sp
The mark value may be optionally followed by "/" and a mask value (used to determine those bits of the connection mark to actually be set)\&. When a mask is specified, the result of logically ANDing the mark value with the mask must be the same as the mark value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFLOG\fR[(\fInflog\-parameters\fR)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.5\&.9\&.3\&. Queues matching packets to a back end logging daemon via a netlink socket then continues to the next rule\&. See
\m[blue]\fBhttp://www\&.shorewall\&.net/shorewall_logging\&.html\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[6]\d\s+2\&.
.sp
Similar to\fB LOG:NFLOG\fR[(\fInflog\-parameters\fR)], except that the log level is not changed when this ACTION is used in an action or macro body and the invocation of that action or macro specifies a log level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNFQUEUE\fR[([\fIqueuenumber\fR1[:\fIqueuenumber2\fR][,bypass]]|bypass)]
.RS 4
Queues the packet to a user\-space application using the nfnetlink_queue mechanism\&. If a
\fIqueuenumber\fR1 is not specified, queue zero (0) is assumed\&. Beginning with Shorewall 4\&.6\&.10, the keyword
\fBbypass\fR
can be given\&. By default, if no userspace program is listening on an NFQUEUE, then all packets that are to be queued are dropped\&. When this option is used, the NFQUEUE rule is silently bypassed instead\&. The packet will move on to the next rule\&. Also beginning in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.10, a second queue number (\fIqueuenumber2\fR) may be specified\&. This specifies a range of queues to use\&. Packets are then balanced across the given queues\&. This is useful for multicore systems: start multiple instances of the userspace program on queues x, x+1, \&.\&. x+n and use "x:x+n"\&. Packets belonging to the same connection are put into the same nfqueue\&.

\fBTARPIT\fR [(\fBtarpit\fR | \fBhoneypot\fR | \fBreset\fR)]
.RS 4
Added in Shorewall 4\&.6\&.6\&.
.sp
TARPIT captures and holds incoming TCP connections using no local per\-connection resources\&.
.sp
TARPIT only works with the PROTO column set to tcp (6), and is totally application agnostic\&. This module will answer a TCP request and play along like a listening server, but aside from sending an ACK or RST, no data is sent\&. Incoming packets are ignored and dropped\&. The attacker will terminate the session eventually\&. This module allows the initial packets of an attack to be captured by other software for inspection\&. In most cases this is sufficient to determine the nature of the attack\&.
.sp
This offers similar functionality to LaBrea <http://www\&.hackbusters\&.net/LaBrea/> but does not require dedicated hardware or IPs\&. Any TCP port that you would normally DROP or REJECT can instead become a tarpit\&.
.sp
The target accepts a single optional parameter:
.PP
tarpit
.RS 4
This mode is the default and completes a connection with the attacker but limits the window size to 0, thus keeping the attacker waiting long periods of time\&. While he is maintaining state of the connection and trying to continue every 60\-240 seconds, we keep none, so it is very lightweight\&. Attempts to close the connection are ignored, forcing the remote side to time out the connection in 12\-24 minutes\&.
.RE
.PP
honeypot
.RS 4
This mode completes a connection with the attacker, but signals a normal window size, so that the remote side will attempt to send data, often with some very nasty exploit attempts\&. We can capture these packets for decoding and further analysis\&. The module does not send any data, so if the remote expects an application level response, the game is up\&.

.RE
.sp
The

.RS 4
May be used to limit the number of simultaneous connections to/from each individual host or network to
\fIlimit\fR
connections\&. Requires connlimit match in your kernel and iptables\&. While the limit is only checked on rules specifying CONNLIMIT, the number of current connections is calculated over all current connections from the SOURCE or DESTINATION host\&. By default, limiting is done by SOURCE host or net, but if the specification begins with
\fBd:\fR, then limiting will be donw by destination host or net\&.
.sp
By default, the limit is applied to each host but can be made to apply to networks of hosts by specifying a
\fImask\fR\&. The
\fImask\fR
specifies the width of a VLSM mask to be applied to the source address; the number of current connections is then taken over all hosts in the subnet
\fIsource\-address\fR/\fImask\fR\&. When\fB !\fR
is specified, the rule matches when the number of connection exceeds the
