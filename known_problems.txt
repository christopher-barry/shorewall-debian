1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  When checking or compiling for export (-e option), /sbin/shorewall
    issues a warning message if the SHOREWALL_SHELL specified in the
    remote firewall's shorewall.conf did not exist.

    Corrected in 4.5.1.1

2)  The changes to TOS handling in 4.5.1 are incompatible with older
    releases such as RHEL5 and derivatives.

    Corrected in 4.5.1.1.

3)  The rules compiler does not verify that the protocol is TCP, UDP,
    SCTP or DCCP when checking a port range (low:high or low-high).

    Corrected in 4.5.1.1.

4)  Start or restart using the init script fails with an error message
    referencing 'SHOREWALL_INIT_SCRIPT'. This defect is generally not
    visible to users that set AUTOMAKE=Yes or that run Shorewall-init.

    Corrected in 4.5.1.1.
