1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'enable', 'reenable' and 'disable' commands do not work
    correctly in configurations with USE_DEFAULT_RT=No and optional
    providers listed in the DUPLICATE column.

3)  The 5.0.12 release notes contain an incorrect example in the
    first new feature. The online version of the notes at
    http://www.shorewall.org/pub/shorewall/5.0/shorewall-5.0.12/releasenotes.txt
    has been corrected.
