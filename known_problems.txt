1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  When the last balanced or fallback interface has been disabled, a
    subsequent enable command will fail.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.1.

3)  When the compiler's environment contains variables whose values
    containe quotes, and EXPORT_PARAMS=No, then the generated script
    can contain syntax errors.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.2

4)  A defect in 4.4.23 prevents DONT_LOAD from working on systems with
    /sys support.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.2.
