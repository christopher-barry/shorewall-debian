1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  Zone names beginning with 'all' are incorectly treated the same as
    'all' in /etc/shorewall/rules and /etc/shorewall6/rules. This
    defect is present in Shorewall versions 4.4.13 through 4.4.22.

    Workaround: Don't give zones names that begin with 'all'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.1.

3)  When LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=No, harmless iptables-restore warning 
    can be generated:

        ...
        Running /usr/local/sbin/iptables-restore...
	--set option deprecated, please use --match-set
	--set option deprecated, please use --match-set
	IPv4 Forwarding Enabled
	...

    Workaround: Simply ignore the warnings or set
    		LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=Yes.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.1.

4)  On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', Shorewall
    4.4.22 and 4.4.22.1 generated invalid iptables-restore input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.2.
