1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'enable', 'reenable' and 'disable' commands do not work
    correctly in configurations with USE_DEFAULT_RT=No and optional
    providers listed in the DUPLICATE column.

3)  When a list of zones appears in a policy file entry, intra-zone
    traffic is affected even if neither the SOURCE nor DEST list ends
    in '+'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 5.0.15.2
