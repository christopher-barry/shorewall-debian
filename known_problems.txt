1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'refresh' command does not automatically reload the rules from
    the BLACKLIST section of the rules file.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.

3)  The rules compiler fails to detect the 'Flow Filter' capability.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.

4)  The IN_BANDWIDTH handling changes in 4.4.25 are incompatible with
    moribund distributions such as RHEL4.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.
