1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The feature introduced in 4.4.25 that allowed provider names in the
    'enable' and 'disable' commands id only implemented for
    'enable'.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

3)  When detecting IPv6 global addresses through an interface, 
    Shorewall6-generated scripts are ignoring addresses beginning
    with '3'.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

4)  A typo in /usr/share/shorewall/prog.header causes an 'awk' script
    to fail when saving a multi-hop default route during 'start'.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

5)  The Shorewall uninstall.sh script removes the manpages from all
    Shorewall packages. Similarly, the Shorewall6 uninstall.sh script
    removes the Shorewall6 Lite manpages along with the Shorewall6
    manpages.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

6)  The value '0' in the IN_BANDWIDTH columns of prevents all incoming
    traffic.

    Workaround: Use '-' instead of '0'.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

7)  MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=Yes generates an error when $FW:<address> is
    entered in the SOURCE column of the tcrules file.

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.

8)  In most Shorewall 4.4 versions, if an exported params file
    (EXPORTPARAMS=Yes in shorewall.conf) generates any output to
    stdout, then the following messages would appear during
    start/restart:

      Compiling /etc/shorewall/routestopped...

         <command> is one of:

    Corrected in 4.4.27.1.
