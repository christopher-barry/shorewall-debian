1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The change in Shorewall 4.5.4 that cleared the 'default' table if
    there were no 'fallback' providers broke multiple 'fallback'
    providers that didn't supply a weight. The symptoms are that there
    are host routes to the default gateways in the 'default' routing
    table but no default routes through them.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.5.1.

3)  When a logical device name is specified in the REDIRECTED
    INTERFACES column of /etc/shorewall/tcdevices, that name is used
    in the generated script rather than the devices's physical
    name. Unless the two are the same, this causes start/restart
    failure.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.5.1.
