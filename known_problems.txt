1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  Handling of the LIBEXEC and PERLLIB environmental variables is
    broken in the installers.

    Workaround: Before running the Shorewall-core installer, edit the
    lib.cli file and modify these two lines as needed:

    	    g_libexec=/usr/share/
	    g_perllib=/usr/share/shorewall/

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.1

3)  If the interface appearing in the HOSTS column of
    /etc/shorewall6/hosts was not defined in
    /etc/shorewall6/interfaces, then the compiler will terminate with
    a Perl diagnostic:

      	   Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at
      	   /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Zones.pm line 1817,
      	   <$currentfile> line ...

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.1.

4)  The Shorewall-init installer installs an incorrect init script
    on Fedora and Redhat systems.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.1.

5)  The init scripts from shorewall.net that are installed on systems
    other than Redhat-based and Debian-based systems are broken.
    
    '/etc/init.d/shorewall start' and /etc/init.d/shorewall restart'
    fail with:

    	 "ERROR: No directory 'start'"

    or

	"ERROR: No directory 'restart'"

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.2

6)  The Shorewall-init installer fails to install ifupdown support for
    PPP devices on Redhat-based systems.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.2

7)  The .service file with Shorewall Init specifies that
    /sbin/shorewall-init should be run for start and stop, but there
    was no such file.

    Workaround: Copy /etc/rc.d/init.d/shorewall-init to
    		/sbin/shorewall-init.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.3

8)  If the variable DEBUG is set to a non-empty value in the environment
    or in /etc/shorewall/params, then 'shorewall stop' and 'shorewall
    clear' do not totally remove the old ruleset and a subsequent
    'shorewall start' will fail.

    Workaround: Do not set the DEBUG variable to a non-empty value.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.0.3
