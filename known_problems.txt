1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  When INLINE_MATCHES=Yes and AUTOHELPERS=No, start or restart can
    fail during script execution with this diagnostic:

      Running /sbin/iptables-restore...
      Bad argument `helper=netbios-ns'
      Error occurred at line: 228
      Try `iptables-restore -h' or 'iptables-restore --help' for more
          information.
        ERROR: iptables-restore Failed. Input is in
               /var/lib/shorewall/.iptables-restore-input

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.6.1.2
