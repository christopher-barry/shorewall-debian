1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'enable', 'reenable' and 'disable' commands do not work
    correctly in configurations with USE_DEFAULT_RT=No.

1)  In 5.0.7, use of an inline match in a rule that generats multiple
    ip[6]tables rules causes only the first generated rule to contain
    the inline match.

    Fixed in 5.0.7.1.

2)  In 5.0.7, if ':R' is specified with the DIVERT action, an error
    message is erroneously generated.

    Workaround: Remove ':R' -- the real PREROUTING chain is the default
    		for DIVERT.

    Fixed in 5.0.7.1.

3)  When using older versions of Perl, the following warnings were
    generated with 5.0.7 and 5.0.7.1.

    Found = in conditional, should be == at
       /usr/share/perl5/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 8630.
    Found = in conditional, should be == at
       /usr/share/perl5/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 8635.

    These may be safely ignored.

    Fixed in 5.0.7.2.

4)  If an inline match is used in the last rule of an action, then the
    inline match can also be erroneously applied to the jump to the
    action's chain.

    Fixed in 5.0.7.2.
