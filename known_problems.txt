1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'refresh' command does not automatically reload the rules from
    the BLACKLIST section of the rules file.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.

3)  The rules compiler fails to detect the 'Flow Filter' capability.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.

4)  The IN_BANDWIDTH handling changes in 4.4.25 are incompatible with
    moribund distributions such as RHEL4.

    Corrected in 4.4.25.1.

5)  Previously, if all the following are true:

    - AUTOMAKE=Yes
    - Current compiled script (/var/lib/shorewall/firewall or
      /var/lib/shorewall6/firewall) up to date
    - LEGACY_FASTSTART=No
    - There is a saved configuration

    then rather than start the current configuration, 'shorewall
    start -f' or 'shorewall6 start -f' incorrectly restores the saved
    configuration.

6)  The DropSmurfs and TCPFlags options are not available in
    Shorewall6.

    Workaround - add these two actions to /etc/shorewall6/actions.
