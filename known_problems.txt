1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The rules compiler does not issue a warning when a capabilities
    file was generated with Shorewall 4.4.25, even though new
    capabilities were added in 4.4.26.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.26.1

3)  When TC_ENABLED=Shared, CLASSIFY rules cannot be used in the
    tcrules file.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.26.1
