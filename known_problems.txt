1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  When the logical and physical name of an interface are different,
    including the logical name in the tcdevices file causes the
    device's classes to be ignored. This defect was introduced in
    Shorewall 4.4.23.

    Workaround: Don't use different logical and physical names for
    interfaces that are subject to complex traffic shaping.

    Corrected in Shorwall 4.4.24.1
