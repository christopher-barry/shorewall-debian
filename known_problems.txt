1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  Zone names beginning with 'all' are incorrectly treated the same as
    'all' in /etc/shorewall/rules and /etc/shorewall6/rules. This
    defect is present in Shorewall versions 4.4.13 through 4.4.22.

    Workaround: Don't give zones names that begin with 'all'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.1.

3)  When LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=No, harmless iptables-restore warning 
    can be generated:

        ...
        Running /usr/local/sbin/iptables-restore...
	--set option deprecated, please use --match-set
	--set option deprecated, please use --match-set
	IPv4 Forwarding Enabled
	...

    Workaround: Simply ignore the warnings or set
    		LOAD_HELPERS_ONLY=Yes.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.1.

4)  On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', Shorewall
    4.4.22 and 4.4.22.1 generated invalid iptables-restore input.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.2.

5)  When Shorewall-init runs the compiled firewall script, it always
    does so using /bin/sh, even if SHOREWALL_SHELL is set to some other
    shell binary in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf (or
    /etc/shorewall6/shorewall6.conf).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.2.

6)  On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Connection Tracking Match: Not Available', harmless Perl
    diagnostics like the following may be issued:

        Use of uninitialized value $list in pattern match (m//) 
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1273,
        <$currentfile> line 14.

        Use of uninitialized value $list in split 
        at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line 1275,
        <$currentfile> line 14.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.3

7)  On older distributions where 'shorewall show capabilities'
    indicates 'Mangle FORWARD Chain: Not Available', entries in the ecn
    file generates the following harmless Perl Diagnostic:

        Use of uninitialized value in hash element 
	at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Chains.pm line 1119.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.3

8)  If a provider interface was derived from an optional
    wildcard entry in /etc/shorewall/providers, then the interface is
    never considered to be usable.

    Example:

	/etc/shorewall/interfaces:

	#ZONE    INTERFACE   BROADCAST    OPTIONS
	net	 ppp+	     -		  optional

  	/etc/shorewall/providers:

	#PROVIDER  NUMBER  MARK  INTERFACE ...
	ISP1	   1	   1	 ppp0	   ...

    Workaround:

    Change /etc/shorewall/interfaces to:

	#ZONE    INTERFACE   BROADCAST    OPTIONS
	net	 ppp0	     -		  optional
	net	 ppp1	     -		  optional
	net	 ppp+	     -		  optional

    and add this to /etc/shorewall/policy.

    	#SOURCE   DEST        POLICY
	net	  net	      NONE

    Note that the new entry must be added ahead of any net->all DROP
    entry.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.22.3
