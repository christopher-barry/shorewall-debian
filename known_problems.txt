1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  When the last balanced or fallback interface has been disabled, a
    subsequent enable command will fail.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.1.

3)  When the compiler's environment contains variables whose values
    containe quotes, and EXPORT_PARAMS=No, then the generated script
    can contain syntax errors.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.2

4)  A defect in 4.4.23 prevents DONT_LOAD from working on systems with
    /sys support.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.2.

5)   When providers are present that specify neither 'balance' nor
    'fallback', then the following message is issued during
    compilation and 'enable' of the interface will fail.

    Use of uninitialized value $weight in concatenation (.) or string
    at /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Providers.pm line 644.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.3.

2)  TC_ENABLED=Shared is broken in Shorewall 4.4.23.*. It produces a 
    shell script with syntax errors.

    Corrected in 4.4.23.3.
