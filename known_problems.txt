1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  If you install 4.6.4 and then use the 'safe-restart' command to
    restart your firewall, confusing output is produced:

      # shorewall safe-restart

      Shorewall configuration compiled to /var/lib/shorewall/.restart
         Currently-running Configuration Saved to /var/lib/shorewall/.safe
      Usage: /var/lib/shorewall/firewall [ options ] <command>

      <command> is one of:
        start
      	stop
      	clear
      	disable <interface>
      	down <interface>
      	enable <interface>
      	reset
      	refresh
      	restart
      	run <command> [ <parameter> ... ]
      	status
      	up <interface>
      	version

      Options are:

         -v and -q        Standard Shorewall verbosity controls
         -n               Don't update routing configuration
         -p               Purge Conntrack Table
         -t               Timestamp progress Messages
         -V <verbosity>   Set verbosity explicitly
         -R <file>        Override RESTOREFILE setting

      Do you want to accept the new firewall configuration? [y/n]

    The above 'usage' information, while confusing, does not represent a
    problem and it is safe to answer 'y'.


    Corrected in Shorewall 4.6.4.1.

3)  The 'Universal' sample configuration fails to start. 

    Workaround: Remove the 'optional' option from the interfaces file
    entry.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.6.4.1.

4)  Setting LOGBACKEND=ipt_LOG may result in the following startup
    failure at boot:

       Starting shorewall ...
       /var/lib/shorewall/firewall: line 2080: echo: write error: No such file or directory
          WARNING: Unable to set log backend to ipt_LOG
