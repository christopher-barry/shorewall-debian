1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'enable', 'reenable' and 'disable' commands do not work
    correctly in configurations with USE_DEFAULT_RT=No and optional
    providers listed in the DUPLICATE column.

3)  In 5.0.14, the two-interface sample snat file has a typo in the
    last line. There is a spurious '1' in the last line.

    Workaround: Edit the file and delete the leading '1' in the last
    line.

    Corrected in 5.0.14.1.
