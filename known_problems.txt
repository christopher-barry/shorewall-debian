1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The 'configure' script described below does not work on RHEL5 and
    derivatives. The version of Bash on those systems does not support
    features used by the script.

    Failure message is:

	./configure: line 28: declare: -A: invalid option

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.1. See the release notes for details.

3)  If an INCLUDE directive appeares inside a ?IF ... ?ENDIF sequence,
    then the following error is generated after the included file had
    been read:

    	  ERROR: Missing ?ENDIF to match the ?IF at line ...

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.1

4)  There is an invalid entry in the shorewallrc.apple file.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.1

5)  The Makefile must be modified manually if either SBINDIR or
    SHAREDIR have a non-standard setting.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.1

6)  The 'version -a' command prints the wrong version for some
    products.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.1

7)  If a shorewallrc file is passed to the the Shorewall 4.4.2.1
    Shorewall-core install script, subsequent compilations
    fail with errors as follows:

    	 Compiling /etc/shorewall/policy...
   	 ERROR: Unable to open /usr                             /share                /shorewall//lib.core: No such file or directory

    Workaround:

	edit /usr/share/shorewall/shorewallrc and delete trailing
    	whitespace in all lines.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.5.2.2.
