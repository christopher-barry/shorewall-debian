1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  Handling of the LIBEXEC and PERLLIB environmental variables is
    broken in the installers.

    Workaround: Before running the Shorewall-core installer, edit the
    lib.cli file and modify these two lines as needed:

    	    g_libexec=/usr/share/
	    g_perllib=/usr/share/shorewall/
