1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  The DNSAmp action released in 4.6.3 matches more packets than it
    should.

    Workaround: Change the single rule in
    /usr/share/shorewall/action.DNSAmp to:

    IPTABLES(@1)	-	-	udp	53	; -m u32 --u32 "0>>22&0x3C\@8&0xffff=0x0100 && 0>>22&0x3C\@12&0xffff0000=0x00010000"

    Corrected in 4.6.3.1.

3)  A typo results in the following misleading error message:

      ERROR: The xxx TARGET is now allowed in the filter table

    The message should read:

      ERROR: The xxx TARGET is not allowed in the filter table

    Corrected in 4.6.3.1.

4)  The shorewall[6]-actions manpages contain incorrect examples
    of the usage of table names with builtin actions.

    Incorrect:

	FOOBAR,filter,mangle

    Correct:

	FOOBAR   builtin,filter,mangle

    The online versions of the manpages have been corrected.

    Corrected in 4.6.3.2.

5)  Including a PREROUTING SECTION in the accounting file
    unconditionally results in a fatal error:

    ERROR: The PREROUTING SECTION is not allowed when
           ACCOUNTING_TABLE=filter

    Corrected in 4.6.3.3.
