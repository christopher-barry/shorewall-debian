#           
#    This file is used to define the hosts that are accessible when
#    the firewall is stopped or is being stopped. When
#    shorewall6-shell is being used, the file also determines those
#    hosts that are accessible when the firewall is in the process
#    of being [re]started.
#           
#    The columns in the file are as follows.
#           
#    INTERFACE - interface
#           Interface through which host(s) communicate with the
#           firewall
#           
#    HOST(S) (Optional) - [-|address[,address]...]
#           Comma-separated list of IP/subnet addresses. If your
#           kernel and ip6tables include iprange match support, IP
#           address ranges are also allowed.
#           
#           If left empty or supplied as "-", 0.0.0.0/0 is assumed.
#           
#    OPTIONS (Optional) - [-|option[,option]...]
#           A comma-separated list of options. The order of the
#           options is not important but the list can contain no
#           embedded whitespace. The currently-supported options
#           are:
#           
#         routeback
#                 Set up a rule to ACCEPT traffic from these hosts
#                 back to themselves. Beginning with Shorewall
#                 4.4.9, this option is automatically set if
#                 routeback is specified in shorewall6-interfaces
#                 (5) or if the rules compiler detects that the
#                 interface is a bridge.
#           
#         source
#                 Allow traffic from these hosts to ANY destination.
#                 Without this option or the dest option, only
#                 traffic from this host to other listed hosts (and
#                 the firewall) is allowed. If source is specified
#                 then routeback is redundant.
#           
#         dest
#                 Allow traffic to these hosts from ANY source.
#                 Without this option or the source option, only
#                 traffic from this host to other listed hosts (and
#                 the firewall) is allowed. If dest is specified
#                 then routeback is redundant.
#           
#         critical
#                 Allow traffic between the firewall and these hosts
#                 throughout '[re]start', 'stop' and 'clear'.
#                 Specifying critical on one or more entries will
#                 cause your firewall to be "totally open" for a
#                 brief window during each of those operations.
#                 Examples of where you might want to use this are:
#           
#                o 'Ping' nodes with heartbeat.
#                o LDAP server(s) if you use LDAP Authentication
#                o NFS Server if you have an NFS-mounted root
#                  filesystem.
#           
#           Note
#           
#    The source and dest options work best when used in conjunction
#    with ADMINISABSENTMINDED=Yes in shorewall6.conf(5).
#           
#           Example
#           
#    Example 1:
#           
#         #INTERFACE      HOST(S)                 OPTIONS
#         eth2            2002:ce7c:92b4::/64
#         eth0            2002:ce7c:92b4:1::/64
#         br0             -                       routeback
#         eth3            -                       source
#
