#           
#           Shorewall-init is an optional package (added in Shorewall 4.4.10) that can be
#           installed along with Shorewall, Shorewall6, Shorewall-lite and/or
#           Shorewall6-lite. It provides two key features:
#           
#  1. It can close (stop) the firewall during boot prior to starting the network.
#     This can prevent unwanted connections from being accepted after the network
#     comes up but before the firewall is started.
#           
#  2. It can interface with your distribution's ifup/ifdown scripts and/or
#     NetworkManager to allow firewall actions when an interface starts or stops.
#           
#           These two capabilities can be enabled separately.
#           
#           After you install the shorewall-init package, you can activate it by modifying
#           the Shorewall-init configuration file:
#           
#   ● On Debian-based system, the file is /etc/default/shorewall-init.
#           
#   ● On other systems, the file is /etc/sysconfig/shorewall-init.
#           
#           To activate the safe boot feature, edit the configuration file and set PRODUCTS
#           to a space-separated list of Shorewall products that you want to be closed
#           before networking starts.
#           
#           Example:
#           
#           PRODUCTS="shorewall shorewall6"
#           
#           You also must insure that the compiled scripts for the listed products are
#           compiled using Shorewall 4.4.10 or later.
#           
#           Shorewall
#           
#     shorewall compile
#           
#           Shorewall6
#           
#     shorewall6 compile
#           
#           Shorewall-lite
#           
#     On the administrative system, enter the command shorewall export firewall
#     from the firewall's configuration directory.
#           
#           Shorewall6-lite
#           
#     On the administrative system, enter the command shorewall6 export firewall
#     from the firewall's configuration directory.
#           
#           The second feature (ifup/ifdown and NetworkManager integration) should only be
#           activated on systems that do not use a link status monitor line swping or LSM.
#           
#   ● Edit the configuration file and set IFUPDOWN=1
#           
#           For NetworkManager integration, you will want to disable firewall startup at
#           boot and delay it to when your interface comes up. For this to work correctly,
#           you must set the required or the optional option on at least one interface
#           then:
#           
#   ● On Debian-based systems, edit /etc/default/product for each product listed
#     in the PRODUCTS setting and set startup=0.
#           
#   ● On other systems, use the distribution's service control tool (insserv,
#     chkconfig, etc.) to disable startup of the products listed in the PRODUCTS
#     setting.
#           
#           On a laptop with both ethernet and wireless interfaces, you will want to make
#           both interfaces optional and set the REQUIRE_INTERFACE option to Yes in
#           shorewall.conf (5) or shorewall6.conf (5). This causes the firewall to remain
#           stopped until at least one of the interfaces comes up.
#
