#           
#    Entries in this file define the bandwidth for interfaces on
#    which you want traffic shaping to be enabled.
#           
#    If you do not plan to use traffic shaping for a device, don't
#    put it in here as it limits the throughput of that device to
#    the limits you set here.
#           
#    A note on the bandwidth definitions used in this file:
#      * don't use a space between the integer value and the unit:
#        30kbit is valid while 30 kbit is not.
#      * you can use one of the following units:
#           
#         kbps
#                 Kilobytes per second.
#           
#         mbps
#                 Megabytes per second.
#           
#         kbit
#                 Kilobits per second.
#           
#         mbit
#                 Megabits per second.
#           
#         bps or number
#                 Bytes per second.
#           
#      * Only whole integers are allowed.
#           
#    The columns in the file are as follows.
#           
#    INTERFACE - [number:]interface
#           Name of interface. Each interface may be listed only
#           once in this file. You may NOT specify the name of an
#           alias (e.g., eth0:0) here; see
#           http://www.shorewall.net/FAQ.htm#faq18
#           
#           You may NOT specify wildcards here, e.g. if you have
#           multiple ppp interfaces, you need to put them all in
#           here!
#           
#           If the device doesn't exist, a warning message will be
#           issued during "shorewall6 [re]start" and "shorewall6
#           refresh" and traffic shaping configuration will be
#           skipped for that device.
#           
#           Shorewall6 assigns a sequential interface number to each
#           interface (the first entry in the file is interface 1,
#           the second is interface 2 and so on) Beginning with
#           Shorewall6-perl 4.1.6, you can explicitly specify the
#           interface number by prefixing the interface name with
#           the number and a colon (":"). Example: 1:eth0.
#           
#    IN-BANDWIDTH - bandwidth[:burst]
#           The incoming bandwidth of that interface. Please note
#           that you are not able to do traffic shaping on incoming
#           traffic, as the traffic is already received before you
#           could do so. But this allows you to define the maximum
#           traffic allowed for this interface in total, if the rate
#           is exceeded, the packets are dropped. You want this
#           mainly if you have a DSL or Cable connection to avoid
#           queuing at your providers side.
#           
#           If you don't want any traffic to be dropped, set this to
#           a value to zero in which case Shorewall6 will not create
#           an ingress qdisc.Must be set to zero if the REDIRECTED
#           INTERFACES column is non-empty.
#           
#           The optional burst option was added in Shorewall6
#           4.4.13. The default burst is 10kb. A larger burst can
#           help make the bandwidth more accurate; often for fast
#           lines, the enforced rate is well below the specified
#           bandwidth.
#           
#    OUT-BANDWIDTH - bandwidth
#           The outgoing bandwidth of that interface. This is the
#           maximum speed your connection can handle. It is also the
#           speed you can refer as "full" if you define the tc
#           classes in shorewall6-tcclasses(5). Outgoing traffic
#           above this rate will be dropped.
#           
#    OPTIONS - {-|{classify|hfsc} ,...}
#           classify - When specified, Shorewall will not generate
#           tc or Netfilter rules to classify traffic based on
#           packet marks. You must do all classification using
#           CLASSIFY rules in shorewall-tcrules(5).
#           
#           hfsc - Shorewall normally uses the Hierarchical Token
#           Bucket queuing discipline. When hfsc is specified, the
#           Hierarchical Fair Service Curves discipline is used
#           instead.
#           
#    REDIRECTED INTERFACES - [interface[,interface]...]
#           Added in Shorewall6-perl 4.1.6. May only be specified if
#           the interface in the INTERFACE column is an Intermediate
#           Frame Block (IFB) device. Causes packets that enter each
#           listed interface to be passed through the egress filters
#           defined for this device, thus providing a form of
#           incoming traffic shaping. When this column is non-empty,
#           the classify option is assumed.
#           
#           Examples
#           
#    Example 1:
#           Suppose you are using PPP over Ethernet (DSL) and ppp0
#           is the interface for this. The device has an outgoing
#           bandwidth of 500kbit and an incoming bandwidth of
#           6000kbit
#
