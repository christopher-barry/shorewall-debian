# Shorewall version 4 - conntrack File
#
# For information about entries in this file, type "man shorewal6-conntrack"
#
##############################################################################################################
# 
# The original intent of the notrack file was to exempt certain traffic from
# Netfilter connection tracking. Traffic matching entries in the file were not to
# be tracked.
# 
# The role of the file was expanded in Shorewall 4.4.27 to include all rules that
# can be added in the Netfilter raw table. In 4.5.7, the file's name was changed
# to conntrack.
# 
# The file supports two different column layouts: FORMAT 1, FORMAT 2, and FORMAT
# 3, FORMAT 1 being the default. The three differ as follows:
# 
#   ● in FORMAT 2 and 3, there is an additional leading ACTION column.
# 
#   ● in FORMAT 3, the SOURCE column accepts no zone name; rather the ACTION
#     column allows a SUFFIX that determines the chain(s) that the generated rule
#     will be added to.
# 
# When an entry in the following form is encountered, the format of the following
# entries are assumed to be of the specified format.
# 
# [?]FORMAT format
# 
# where format is either 1,2 or 3.
# 
# Format 3 was introduced in Shorewall 4.5.10. The optional '?' was introduced in
# Shorewall 4.5.11 and ?FORMAT is the preferred form; the form without the '?' is
# deprecated.
# 
# Comments may be attached to Netfilter rules generated from entries in this file
# through the use of COMMENT lines. These lines begin with the word COMMENT; the
# remainder of the line is treated as a comment which is attached to subsequent
# rules until another COMMENT line is found or until the end of the file is
# reached. To stop adding comments to rules, use a line with only the word
# COMMENT.
# 
# Note
# 
# Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.11, ?COMMENT is a synonym for COMMENT and is
# preferred.
# 
# The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is followed by a
# different name in parentheses, the different name is used in the alternate
# specification syntax).
# 
# ACTION - {NOTRACK|CT:helper:name[(arg=val[,...])|CT:notrack|drop}[:
#     chain-designator]
# 
#     This column is only present when FORMAT >= 2. Values other than NOTRACK
#     require CT Target support in your iptables and kernel.
# 
#       ● NOTRACK or CT:notrack
# 
#         Disables connection tracking for this packet.
# 
#       ● DROP
# 
#         Added in Shorewall 4.5.10. Silently discard the packet.
# 
#       ● helper:name
# 
#         Attach the helper identified by the name to this connection. This is
#         more flexible than loading the conntrack helper with preset ports. May
#         be followed by an option list of arg=val pairs in parentheses:
# 
#           ○ ctevents=event[,...]
# 
#             Only generate the specified conntrack events for this connection.
#             Possible event types are: new, related, destroy, reply, assured,
#             protoinfo, helper, mark (this is connection mark, not packet mark),
#             natseqinfo, and secmark. If more than one event is listed, the
#             event list must be enclosed in parentheses (e.g., ctevents=
#             (new,related)).
# 
#           ○ expevents=new
# 
#             Only generate a new expectation events for this connection.
# 
#     When FORMAT = 1, this column is not present and the rule is processed as if
#     NOTRACK had been entered in this column.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10, when FORMAT = 3, this column can end with
#     a colon followed by a chain-designator. The chain-designator can be one of
#     the following:
# 
#     P
# 
#         The rule is added to the raw table PREROUTING chain. This is the
#         default if no chain-designator is present.
# 
#     O
# 
#         The rule is added to the raw table OUTPUT chain.
# 
#     PO or OP
# 
#         The rule is added to the raw table PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains.
# 
# SOURCE (formats 1 and 2) ‒ zone[:interface][:address-list]
# 
#     where zone is the name of a zone, interface is an interface to that zone,
#     and address-list is a comma-separated list of addresses (may contain
#     exclusion - see shorewall6-exclusion (5)).
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.7, all can be used as the zone name to mean
#     all zones.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.10, all- can be used as the zone name to mean
#     all off-firewall zones.
# 
# SOURCE (format 3) ‒ {-|interface[:address-list]|address-list}
# 
#     Where interface is an interface to that zone, and address-list is a
#     comma-separated list of addresses (may contain exclusion - see
#     shorewall-exclusion (5)).
# 
#     COMMENT is only allowed in format 1; the remainder of the line is treated
#     as a comment that will be associated with the generated rule(s).
# 
# DEST ‒ {-|interface[:address-list]|address-list}
# 
#     where address-list is a comma-separated list of addresses (may contain
#     exclusion - see shorewall6-exclusion (5)).
# 
# PROTO ‒ protocol-name-or-number[,...]
# 
#     A protocol name from /etc/protocols or a protocol number.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.12, this column can accept a comma-separated
#     list of protocols.
# 
# DEST PORT(S) (dport) - port-number/service-name-list
# 
#     A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from /etc/
#     services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port if
#     your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
# SOURCE PORT(S) (sport) - port-number/service-name-list
# 
#     A comma-separated list of port numbers and/or service names from /etc/
#     services. May also include port ranges of the form low-port:high-port if
#     your kernel and iptables include port range support.
# 
#     Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.15, you may place '=' in this column, provided
#     that the DEST PORT(S) column is non-empty. This causes the rule to match
#     when either the source port or the destination port in a packet matches one
#     of the ports specified in DEST PORTS(S).
# 
# USER/GROUP (user) ‒ [user][:group]
# 
#     May only be specified if the SOURCE zone is $FW. Specifies the effective
#     user id and or group id of the process sending the traffic.
# 
# SWITCH - [!]switch-name[={0|1}]
# 
#     Added in Shorewall6 4.5.10 and allows enabling and disabling the rule
#     without requiring shorewall6 restart.
# 
#     Enables the rule if the value stored in /proc/net/nf_condition/switch-name
#     is 1. Disables the rule if that file contains 0 (the default). If '!' is
#     supplied, the test is inverted such that the rule is enabled if the file
#     contains 0.
# 
#     Within the switch-name, '@0' and '@{0}' are replaced by the name of the
#     chain to which the rule is a added. The switch-name (after '@...'
#     expansion) must begin with a letter and be composed of letters, decimal
#     digits, underscores or hyphens. Switch names must be 30 characters or less
#     in length.
# 
#     Switches are normally off. To turn a switch on:
# 
#     echo 1 > /proc/net/nf_condition/switch-name
# 
#     To turn it off again:
# 
#     echo 0 > /proc/net/nf_condition/switch-name
# 
#     Switch settings are retained over shorewall6 restart.
# 
#     When the switch-name is followed by =0 or =1, then the switch is
#     initialized to off or on respectively by the start command. Other commands
#     do not affect the switch setting.
# 
# EXAMPLES
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Use the FTP helper for TCP port 21 connections from the firewall itself.
