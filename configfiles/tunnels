#           
#    The tunnels file is used to define rules for encapsulated
#    (usually encrypted) traffic to pass between the Shorewall6
#    system and a remote gateway. Traffic flowing through the tunnel
#    is handled using the normal zone/policy/rule mechanism. See
#    http://www.shorewall.net/VPNBasics.html for details.
#           
#    The columns in the file are as follows.
#           
#    TYPE -
#           {ipsec[:{noah|ah}]|ipsecnat|gre|l2tp|pptpclient|pptpserve
#           r|{openvpn|openvpnclient|openvpnserver}[:{tcp|udp}][:por
#           t]|generic:protocol[:port]}
#           Types are as follows:
#           
#         ipsec         - IPv6 IPSEC
#         ipsecnat      - IPv6 IPSEC with NAT Traversal (UDP port 4500 enc
#           apsulation)
#         gre           - Generalized Routing Encapsulation (Protocol 47)
#         l2tp          - Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (UDP port 1701)
#         openvpn       - OpenVPN in point-to-point mode
#         openvpnclient - OpenVPN client runs on the firewall
#         openvpnserver - OpenVPN server runs on the firewall
#         generic       - Other tunnel type
#           
#           If the type is ipsec, it may be followed by :ah to
#           indicate that the Authentication Headers protocol (51)
#           is used by the tunnel (the default is :noah which means
#           that protocol 51 is not used). NAT traversal is only
#           supported with ESP (protocol 50) so ipsecnat tunnels
#           don't allow the ah option (ipsecnat:noah may be
#           specified but is redundant).
#           
#           If type is openvpn, openvpnclient or openvpnserver it
#           may optionally be followed by ":" and tcp or udp to
#           specify the protocol to be used. If not specified, udp
#           is assumed. Note: At this writing, OpenVPN does not
#           support IPv6.
#           
#           If type is openvpn, openvpnclient or openvpnserver it
#           may optionally be followed by ":" and the port number
#           used by the tunnel. if no ":" and port number are
#           included, then the default port of 1194 will be used. .
#           Where both the protocol and port are specified, the
#           protocol must be given first (e.g., openvpn:tcp:4444).
#           
#           If type is generic, it must be followed by ":" and a
#           protocol name (from /etc/protocols) or a protocol
#           number. If the protocol is tcp or udp (6 or 17), then it
#           may optionally be followed by ":" and a port number.
#           
#    ZONE - zone
#           The zone of the physical interface through which tunnel
#           traffic passes. This is normally your internet zone.
#           
#    GATEWAY - address-or-range
#           The IP address of the remote tunnel gateway. If the
#           remote gateway has no fixed address (Road Warrior) then
#           specify the gateway as ::/0. May be specified as a
#           network address and if your kernel and ip6tables include
#           iprange match support then IP address ranges are also
#           allowed.
#           
#    GATEWAY ZONES (Optional) - [zone[,zone]...]
#           If the gateway system specified in the third column is a
#           standalone host then this column should contain a
#           comma-separated list of the names of the zones that the
#           host might be in. This column only applies to IPSEC
#           tunnels where it enables ISAKMP traffic to flow through
#           the tunnel to the remote gateway.
#           
#           Example
#           
#    Example 1:
#           IPSec tunnel.
#           
#           The remote gateway is 2001:cec792b4:1::44. The tunnel
#           does not use the AH protocol
#           
#         #TYPE           ZONE    GATEWAY
#         ipsec:noah      net     2002:cec792b4:1::44
#           
#    Example 2:
#           Road Warrior (LapTop that may connect from anywhere)
#           where the "gw" zone is used to represent the remote
#           LapTop
#           
#         #TYPE           ZONE    GATEWAY                 GATEWAY ZONES
#         ipsec           net     ::/0                    gw
#           
#    Example 3:
#           Host 2001:cec792b4:1::44 is a standalone system
#           connected via an ipsec tunnel to the firewall system.
#           The host is in zone gw.
#           
#         #TYPE           ZONE    GATEWAY                 GATEWAY ZONES
#         ipsec           net     2001:cec792b4:1::44     gw
#           
#    Example 4:
#           OPENVPN tunnel. The remote gateway is
#           2001:cec792b4:1::44 and openvpn uses port 7777.
#           
#         #TYPE           ZONE    GATEWAY                 GATEWAY ZONES
#         openvpn:7777    net     2001:cec792b4:1::44
#           
#    Example 8:
#           You have a tunnel that is not one of the supported
#           types. Your tunnel uses UDP port 4444. The other end of
#           the tunnel is 2001:cec792b4:1::44.
#           
#         #TYPE            ZONE    GATEWAY                GATEWAY ZONES
#         generic:udp:4444 net     2001:cec792b4:1::44
