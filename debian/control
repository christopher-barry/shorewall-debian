Description: Shorewall initialization 
 This package provides two related features:
 .
    a)  It allows the firewall to be closed prior to bringing up
        network devices. This insures that unwanted connections are not
        allowed between the time that the network comes up and when the
        firewall is started.
 .
    b)  It integrates with NetworkManager and distribution ifup/ifdown
        systems to allow for 'event-driven' startup and shutdown.
 .
 The two facilities can be enabled separately.
 .
 When Shorewall-init is first installed, it does nothing until you
 configure it.
