Description: Shoreline Firewall, netfilter configurator
 Shorewall allows firewall/gateway requirements to be described using
 entries in a set of configuration files. It reads those configuration
 files and, with the help of the iptables utility, configures
 netfilter to match these requirements.
 .
 Shorewall supports a wide range of router/firewall/gateway applications,
 traffic shaping and almost every type of VPN.
