Shorewall Debian packaging README:
----------------------------------

There are five (5) Shorewall packages released by upstream:
  shorewall
  shorewall-lite
  shorewall6
  shorewall6-lite
  shorewall-doc

Each of the above packages released by upstream corresponds to a Debian
package of the same name.  In order to keep from managing a separate git
repository for each package, they are all contained in branches of this
repository:

* master
  pristine-tar
  shorewall-doc/master
  shorewall-doc/upstream
  shorewall-lite/master
  shorewall-lite/upstream
  shorewall/master
  shorewall/upstream
  shorewall6-lite/master
  shorewall6-lite/upstream
  shorewall6/master
  shorewall6/upstream

This repository is designed to be used with the git-buildpackage program,
and so, each master branch is the Debian package branch, while each upstream
branch is the unmodified upstream source.  The pristine-tar program is also
used to create the tarball from the pristine-tar branch.

When you first clone the repository, the only local branch you will have is
the master branch.  In order to get copies of the other branches (so that
git-buildpackage will work for you), you will need to execute this (only
once):

git branch --track pristine-tar origin/pristine-tar ; for i in `git branch -a |grep shorewall |cut -f3 -d' ' |cut -f2 -d'/' |sort -u ` ; do git branch --track $i/master origin/$i/master ; git branch --track $i/upstream origin/$i/upstream ; done

To build one or more of the packages, please use the build.sh script found in
this directory.
