Shorewall Debian packaging README:
----------------------------------

There are five (5) Shorewall packages released by upstream:
  shorewall
  shorewall-lite
  shorewall6
  shorewall6-lite
  shorewall-doc

Each of the above packages released by upstream corresponds to a Debian
package of the same name.  In order to keep from managing a separate git
repository for each package, they are all contained in branches of this
repository:

* master
  pristine-tar
  shorewall-doc/master
  shorewall-doc/upstream
  shorewall-lite/master
  shorewall-lite/upstream
  shorewall/master
  shorewall/upstream
  shorewall6-lite/master
  shorewall6-lite/upstream
  shorewall6/master
  shorewall6/upstream

This branch is designed to be used with the git-buildpackage program, and so,
each master branch is the Debian package branch, while each upstream branch
is the unmodified upstream source.  The pristine-tar program is also used to
create the tarball from the pristine-tar branch.

To build one or more of the packages, please use the build.sh script found in
this directory.
